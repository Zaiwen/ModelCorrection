"I have a like new in box, Sig Sauer P238 SAS, 380 Auto I purchased this gun new last year, have put 25 rounds through it. It is in perfect flawless condition . I purchased graphite scales from Sig, for every day carry, so I wouldnt beat up the wood scales. However Ive never carried the gun! It comes with the box and all original papers, a previously owned DM Bullard PWC (pocket/wallet combo) formed leather holster $80 if new, a pocket holster from the Desantis $20 new, a hip poster from Sig, two clips one with a finger extension.  The SAS upgrade on these pistols is the model where all the corners have been filed down smooth and round at the factory l, so when you withdraw the pistol theres nothing to snag everything has been rounded off for a smooth finish  I would consider a trade for a stainless steel 357, 4, in very good condition.
