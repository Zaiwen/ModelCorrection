The shortened grip is ideal for concealed carry and maintains the longer barrel length and sight radius of the G19. Also, the longer barrel helps control recoil as compared to a G26. I've run several hundred rounds the pistol with zero malfunctions - it eats anything you feed it.     Also has Glock front night sight and an ICE Claw EMS rear sight.         Looking for a partial trade for Walther PPQ (I'll include cash) or cash. I also have several holsters.",
