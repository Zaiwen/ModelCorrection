Here is a link of a review of the gun, compared to other pocket pistols.  https://youtu.be/0K6vKL0mmXQ"

Stoeger Arms Company in July 1929 and it was fitted, by them, a case colored slotted MSH for an Ideal shoulder stock. As you may know, these where outlawed with the Gun Control Act of 1934. Rumor is Dillinger had several of them. It has the original two tone magazine, correct unmarked barrel with a mint bore, correct wood grips, checkered thumb safety, matching serial number on the slide. There is some blue wear on the edges & a touch of scattered freckles. I would rate the pistol at 97%. Buyer pays shipping"
