As an influential pioneer of the Environmental and Conceptual Art movements, Denes鈥檚 artistic practice applies the exacting precision and unwavering consistency of mathematics to the often subjective, tenuous, and unstable concepts of ecological awareness and environmental sustainability. The three discrete bodies of work on view at SMMoA demonstrate how Denes marshals the disciplines of geometry, philosophy, cartography, and the physical sciences to create 鈥淰isual Philosophy�?鈥攈er signature method of illustrating how we exist in the world. The exhibition will be on view at SMMoA from September 15 through December 22, 2012.nOrganized by SMMoA s newly appointed curator-at-large Jeffrey Uslip,聽Agnes Denes: Body Prints, Philosophical Drawings, and Map Projections, 1969 �?1978聽revisits the complex theoretical propositions Denes set forth at the onset of her career. For the past five decades, Denes鈥檚 practice has become synonymous with ecologically driven interventions into the landscape and socially driven approaches that symbiotically engage with the environment. Denes鈥檚 Body Prints overlay impressions of human breasts and phalluses onto sheets of graph paper to humorously, yet poignantly, transform the body into social critique.nIn聽Napoleonic Series: Investigation of World Rulers I   Napoleon Overlooking the Elba�?1971), Denes transfers the impressions of four penises onto graph paper, creating a sardonic allegory for a, perhaps inadequate, representation of male power. Denes locates this drawing on Elba, the island off the western coast of Italy where Napoleon was first exiled in 1814. By contrast,聽Design of the Universe�?1971) reveals a body print of a female breast morphologically likened to the globe in a more optimistic and fertile projection of the future.nDenes鈥檚 series of聽Philosophical Drawings聽appropriates the veracity of mathematical symmetry and geometric codes to provide shape 鈥攁 visual logic鈥攖o ways of聽being聽in the world and聽visualizing聽invisible passages of time.聽Map Projections聽depicts the globe reconfigured in various spatial distortions and three-dimensional shapes, including seashells, dodecahedrons, ova, cubes, and pyramids. While always academically rigorous, Denes never forgoes her insightful wit: in the drawing聽Isometric Systems in Isotropic Space   Map Projections: The Hot Dog�?1976), the world is rendered as an elongated, phallic hot dog. Denes鈥檚 method of embedding meaning within the structure of geometric forms allows her to interrogate and undermine issues of representation through Cartesian order. Or more poetically, in Denes鈥檚 words, 鈥淚 love mathematics because I could humanize it, and in turn it gave me perfection and beauty.鈥澛燶nThe catalog for this exhibition is made possible by Peter A. Gelles and Eve Steele Gelles and Leslie Tonkonow Artworks + Projects.nMajor support for Santa Monica Museum of Art exhibitions has been provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

As an influential pioneer of the Environmental and Conceptual Art movements, Denes鈥檚 artistic practice applies the exacting precision and unwavering consistency of mathematics to the often subjective, tenuous, and unstable concepts of ecological awareness and environmental sustainability. The three discrete bodies of work on view at SMMoA demonstrate how Denes marshals the disciplines of geometry, philosophy, cartography, and the physical sciences to create 鈥淰isual Philosophy�?鈥攈er signature method of illustrating how we exist in the world. The exhibition will be on view at SMMoA from September 15 through December 22, 2012.nOrganized by SMMoA s newly appointed curator-at-large Jeffrey Uslip,聽Agnes Denes: Body Prints, Philosophical Drawings, and Map Projections, 1969 �?1978聽revisits the complex theoretical propositions Denes set forth at the onset of her career. For the past five decades, Denes鈥檚 practice has become synonymous with ecologically driven interventions into the landscape and socially driven approaches that symbiotically engage with the environment. Denes鈥檚 Body Prints overlay impressions of human breasts and phalluses onto sheets of graph paper to humorously, yet poignantly, transform the body into social critique.nIn聽Napoleonic Series: Investigation of World Rulers I   Napoleon Overlooking the Elba�?1971), Denes transfers the impressions of four penises onto graph paper, creating a sardonic allegory for a, perhaps inadequate, representation of male power. Denes locates this drawing on Elba, the island off the western coast of Italy where Napoleon was first exiled in 1814. By contrast,聽Design of the Universe�?1971) reveals a body print of a female breast morphologically likened to the globe in a more optimistic and fertile projection of the future.nDenes鈥檚 series of聽Philosophical Drawings聽appropriates the veracity of mathematical symmetry and geometric codes to provide shape 鈥攁 visual logic鈥攖o ways of聽being聽in the world and聽visualizing聽invisible passages of time.聽Map Projections聽depicts the globe reconfigured in various spatial distortions and three-dimensional shapes, including seashells, dodecahedrons, ova, cubes, and pyramids. While always academically rigorous, Denes never forgoes her insightful wit: in the drawing聽Isometric Systems in Isotropic Space   Map Projections: The Hot Dog�?1976), the world is rendered as an elongated, phallic hot dog. Denes鈥檚 method of embedding meaning within the structure of geometric forms allows her to interrogate and undermine issues of representation through Cartesian order. Or more poetically, in Denes鈥檚 words, 鈥淚 love mathematics because I could humanize it, and in turn it gave me perfection and beauty.鈥澛燶nThe catalog for this exhibition is made possible by Peter A. Gelles and Eve Steele Gelles and Leslie Tonkonow Artworks + Projects.nMajor support for Santa Monica Museum of Art exhibitions has been provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

Best known for her elaborate paintings of African American women against the backdrop of d茅cor recalled from her childhood, Thomas has created an all-new suite of works that examine aspects of landscape painting. She introduces a new model of trans-generational female empowerment as she explores interior and exterior environments in relation to the female figure. The exhibition opens at SMMoA on April 14, 2012 and continues through August 18, 2012. It will then travel to the Brooklyn Museum for display from September 28, 2012 to January 20, 2013.nThomas is best known for her bold enamel and acrylic paintings adorned with rhinestones, glitter, and  bling.  Her subjects seem to have stepped directly from a 1970s Blaxploitation film, yet Thomas s influences extend far beyond. Her oeuvre stems from her long study of art history and the classical genres of portraiture, landscape, and still life. Thomas s layered聽facture聽process begins with a photographic portrait that is translated into a collage, and ultimately reenvisioned as a painting. Her imagery comprises careful borrowings from art history and from contemporary popular culture.nFor聽Origin of the Universe, Thomas examines art historical constructs of feminine identity, sexuality, beauty, and power in 15 works in a variety of sizes, shapes, and media. Taking cues from Marcel Duchamp s聽脡tant Donn茅s: 1�?la chute d eau, 2�?le gaz d 茅clairage�?Given: 1.聽The Waterfall, 2.聽The Illuminating Gas) and Gustave Courbet s L Origine du Monde (The Origin of the World), Thomas presents the female figure as the origin of the universe, focusing on how the female body both engenders and inhabits landscape. The works on view are in communication with one another portraits of Qusuquzah and Din gaze out at modernist interiors and plein-air landscapes, all confronted by the artist s arresting recreations of Courbet s Origin.nIn nineteenth-century visual culture, black female sexuality functioned as something to be rejected or disparaged, but Thomas reconfigures these historical tropes into contemporary statements of empowerment. By casting African American women as the  heroines  of her works, she makes a profound statement regarding gender and racial identity. Thomas s dialogue with Courbet and Duchamp is a strong reclamation of history, reasserting the subjective nature of beauty. In addition to her paintings and photographs, she will create an installation in SMMoA s Project Room 1, to reinvent聽脡tant Donn茅s, where the  peep show  reveals the true surprise of a 70s-style paneled interior in the place of Duchamp s splayed female body.nSome content may be deemed inappropriate for younger viewers.nMickalene Thomas was born in 1971. She earned a Bachelor s of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute and a Master s of Fine Arts from Yale University. She has participated in residency programs at the Versailles Foundation Munn Artists Program, Giverny, France, and the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York. Her work has been shown in group exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, The Renaissance Society, Chicago, and MoMA PS1, New York, and is included in the important collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; The Museum of Fine Arts Boston; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.nMickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe聽is organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art; SMMoA Deputy Director Lisa Melandri is the exhibition curator. The exhibition will be accompanied by a series of free, engaging public programs and a full-color, illustrated catalog published by SMMoA and distributed by DAP. The publication includes an interview with the artist by Melandri; an essay that contextualizes Thomas s work by writer/curator Sarah Lewis, Professor at Yale University School of Art; and an in-depth investigation of Thomas s nineteenth-century influences by scholar Denise Murrell,聽a 2011 PhD Dissertation Fellow at Reid Hall of Columbia University in Paris.nGenerous support for this exhibition has been provided by The National Endowment for the Arts, Lehmann Maupin Gallery, New York, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, and Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects. Additional support has also been provided by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors through the Los Angeles County Arts Commission and Janine and Lyndon Barrois.n nAll images �?Mickalene Thomas, Lehmann Maupin Gallery, New York, and Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects, Photo: Christopher Burke Studion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

These unusual glass-blown forms are the result of a unique collaboration between students from Santa Monica High School, Olympic High School, and Virginia Avenue Park Teen Center, and students from the Watts Labor Community Action Committee s (WLCAC) glass program. In addition, the exhibition will feature a film that shows the participants  process of learning how to blow glass and the skill-sharing that develops between students throughout the program.nThe free Park Studio: Complex Elements education program took place during the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District s (SMMUSD) spring break, from April 2 through April 5, 2012. Held at the WLCAC s glass studio in Watts, Park Studio: Complex Elements included a visit to SMMoA and the Watts Towers. Participating students learned the practice of glass blowing from WLCAC artist Jaime Guerrero and his assistant, artist Richard Franco, as well as from year-round students in the WLCAC glass program. All workshops included transportation, lunch, refreshments, and art materials.nComplex Elements highlights the collaboration between the disparate communities of Santa Monica and Watts. Students from Santa Monica are recruited from the Pico/Cloverfield neighborhood, Virginia Avenue Park Teen Center, Santa Monica High School s Art Program, and Olympic High School (a continuation school where students are eligible for semester elective credit toward obtaining their high school diploma). Students from the WLCAC glass program will help to impart the knowledge of glass blowing to the youth from Santa Monica and will exhibit their work at SMMoA.nEach year, Park Studio explores themes that combine art and urban life. The glass blowing program in Watts works with at-risk youth to build confidence, pride, and skills to work collaboratively through the creation of glass objects. Glass is beautiful and fragile a metaphor for high-school student s transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Park Studio, founded in 1999 by SMMoA s Director of Education Asuka Hisa, is an innovative interdisciplinary art education program that serves the community. Through Park Studio, SMMoA brings local students and contemporary artists together for workshops, art history lessons and field trips to cultural sites, offering extraordinary extra-curricular opportunities to students for free.nSupport for Park Studio: Complex Elements has been provided by the City of Santa Monica Cultural Affairs Grant Program and the Eileen Harris Norton Family Foundation. In-kind support has been provided by Bergamot Station Arts Center, IZZE, Cliff Bar, Bergamot Caf�? and the Virginia Avenue Park Teen Center.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Patrons were encouraged to trust their instincts to guide their selections, as all works are signed on the back and artist identities are not revealed until after purchase.nA celebratory reception featuring music by DJs Cassie Coane and Harley Viera-Newton, included delicious hors d oeuvres from Food by Lene, and a wide range of libations by Patron, Malibu Family Wines, Pressed Juicery, and POM Wonderful. Media sponsors were Los Angeles Magazine and KCRW 89.9 FM.nOne hundred percent of the proceeds will benefit SMMoA s highly acclaimed exhibition, education, and outreach programs.n(For the list of this year s participating artists, please scroll down.)nINCOGNITO�?012 Committee:nPrice Latimer Agah (Committee Chair), Claressinka Anderson, Matt and Abby Bangser,聽Nancy Chaikin, Max Chow, John Cournoyer, Charlotte Eyerman, Laura Fried, Alejandro Gehry, Francois Ghebaly, Justin Gilanyi, Jean-Christophe Harel, Heather Harmon, Gail Katz,聽Jordan Klein, Nancy Klein, Bettina Korek, Mills Moran, Ragna Nervik, Bruce Samuels, MD, Leigh Silverton.nLuminary SupportersnGood Works Foundation and Laura Donnelley, Eileen Harris Norton, Hauser   Wirth, The John   Marilyn Wells Family Foundation, Randi and Harlan SteinbergernVisionary SupportersnShoshana and Wayne S.

Tushev s signature works explore the dynamism of pigment, the physical possibilities of paint, and the transformation of matter. He uses pigments that contain high concentrations of iron that, when exposed to magnets, create textured, three-dimensional surfaces, where paint seemingly explodes off the picture plane. Tushev s works on paper are made through a similar technique, though in water, where the magnetic fields separate the watercolor pigments into areas of black, white, and gray and create concentric rings and circular patterns.nTushev s abstract pictorial space is evocative of natural forms and biological processes. On the macro level, the work appears geological, celestial like lunar terrain. On the micro level, it suggests a view from under the microscope of cell division and mitosis. Tushev s method is inherently experimental; his compositions are subject to varying degrees of chance and instability. His long-time scientific testing of material has resulted in works that are arresting in form and astonishing in process.nStrange Attractor is the first Los Angeles show for Tushev and his debut museum exhibition; it also marks the inauguration of NY/LA, the Museum s new exhibition series that connects contemporary art on both coasts.

Tushev s signature works explore the dynamism of pigment, the physical possibilities of paint, and the transformation of matter. He uses pigments that contain high concentrations of iron that, when exposed to magnets, create textured, three-dimensional surfaces, where paint seemingly explodes off the picture plane. Tushev s works on paper are made through a similar technique, though in water, where the magnetic fields separate the watercolor pigments into areas of black, white, and gray and create concentric rings and circular patterns.nTushev s abstract pictorial space is evocative of natural forms and biological processes. On the macro level, the work appears geological, celestial like lunar terrain. On the micro level, it suggests a view from under the microscope of cell division and mitosis. Tushev s method is inherently experimental; his compositions are subject to varying degrees of chance and instability. His long-time scientific testing of material has resulted in works that are arresting in form and astonishing in process.nStrange Attractor is the first Los Angeles show for Tushev and his debut museum exhibition; it also marks the inauguration of NY/LA, the Museum s new exhibition series that connects contemporary art on both coasts. Strange Attractor is organized by New York-based curator Jeffrey Uslip.nTushev (b. 1974) was born in Bulgaria and lives and works in New York City. He earned a graduate degree from the National Academy of Fine Arts, Sofia, Bulgaria, and completed a residency at the Santa Fe Art Institute, New Mexico, and a Master Class of Painting in Amsterdam with painter Markus Lupertz.nTushev s work has been represented in solo exhibitions in San Francisco at Noma Gallery and in Sofia, Bulgaria, at XXL Gallery.nSupport for Georgi Tushev: Strange Attractor has been provided in part by Peter Gelles and Eve Steele Gelles.n nNY/LA: A New, Annual Exhibition Series" .

SMMoA Executive Director Elsa Longhauser and Deputy Director Lisa Melandri are co-curators for the exhibition.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman is part of Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980. This unprecedented collaboration, initiated by the Getty, brings together more than sixty cultural institutions from across Southern California for six months beginning October 2011 to tell the story of the birth of the L.A. art scene. An artist who worked on both the East and West coasts and bridged gaps between areas as disparate as New York Dada and Southern California ceramics, Wood (1893-1998) was a vital contributor to the art scene of the period and is thus a key player in the Pacific Standard Time project.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman includes over 100 works of art. The exhibition begins with Wood s early Dada work, which includes drawings, paintings, posters, prints, and illustrated albums and travelogues. Wood first encountered Dada a primary creative and personal influence in New York, arising from her intimate friendships with Marcel Duchamp and the collectors Walter and Louise Arensberg. It was Dada that first inspired Wood to become an artist, and it shaped her creative thinking for the rest of her life. The exhibition also feature prominent examples of Wood s ceramics created from the 1940s until her death in 1998. Wood was exceptionally prolific, even given her remarkable longevity. She repeatedly investigated and revisited a number of subjects, forms, and materials over a 60- to 70-year period.nThough Wood did not turn to ceramics until 1933 at the age of 40, she became an accomplished clay artist and went on to produce some of her most notable works well into her 90s. Her experimentation with ceramic glazing and firing was extraordinary, a compendium of clay technique. She first began to experiment with clay pieces that took the form of tiles or plates. By the 1980s, Wood was creating objects on a much larger scale, such as colossal goblets more than a foot tall and wide. The exhibition will survey the full range of her ceramics from the miniature to the large-scale, from the utilitarian to the decorative, and from the vessel to figurative sculpture.nA fully-illustrated 144-page comprehensive catalog, published by the Santa Monica Museum of Art, accompanies the exhibition and offers a scholarly assessment of Beatrice Wood. This elegant publication includes 58 full-color plates, over 90 photographs, forward and acknowledgements by curators Elsa Longhauser and Lisa Melandri, original texts by Garth Clark, Kathleen Pyne and Jenni Sorkin, Wood s original diaries annotated and edited by Francis M. Naumann and Marie T. Keller, and a chronology by Lida M. Sunderland. The catalog s essays range from the examination of Wood s threshold position in early modernism, to her relationship with the Theosophical community in Ojai, as well as a technical evaluation of her work in clay. Wood began her life in art as a dilettante, and emerged a serious artist, nearly fifty years later. The accompanying writings illuminate the evolution of her work and document the art historical trajectory that delineates her vibrant contribution to the canon of Twentieth Century art.nWood created a complex, thoughtful, and inexhaustible oeuvre, one that is equal parts narrative and form, equal parts poetry and wit. Her irrepressible sensibility could be bold, audacious, insouciant, sexually charged, and at times biographical. This exhibition will honor Wood s indomitable spirit and dynamic artistic force, a pairing that produced a mature body of work that defines her importance as an artist.

Each institution will make its own contribution to this grand-scale story of artistic innovation and social change, told through a multitude of simultaneous exhibitions and programs. Exploring and celebrating the significance of the crucial post-World War II years through the tumultuous period of the 1960s and 70s, Pacific Standard Time encompasses developments from L.A. Pop to post-minimalism; from modernist architecture and design to multi-media installations; from the films of the African American L.A. Rebellion to the feminist activities of the Woman s Building; from ceramics to Chicano performance art; and from Japanese American design to the pioneering work of artists  collectives. Initiated through $10 million in grants from the Getty Foundation, Pacific Standard Time involves cultural institutions of every size and character across Southern California, from Greater Los Angeles to San Diego and Santa Barbara to Palm Springs.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

SMMoA Executive Director Elsa Longhauser and Deputy Director Lisa Melandri are co-curators for the exhibition.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman is part of Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980. This unprecedented collaboration, initiated by the Getty, brings together more than sixty cultural institutions from across Southern California for six months beginning October 2011 to tell the story of the birth of the L.A. art scene. An artist who worked on both the East and West coasts and bridged gaps between areas as disparate as New York Dada and Southern California ceramics, Wood (1893-1998) was a vital contributor to the art scene of the period and is thus a key player in the Pacific Standard Time project.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman includes over 100 works of art. The exhibition begins with Wood s early Dada work, which includes drawings, paintings, posters, prints, and illustrated albums and travelogues. Wood first encountered Dada a primary creative and personal influence in New York, arising from her intimate friendships with Marcel Duchamp and the collectors Walter and Louise Arensberg. It was Dada that first inspired Wood to become an artist, and it shaped her creative thinking for the rest of her life. The exhibition also feature prominent examples of Wood s ceramics created from the 1940s until her death in 1998. Wood was exceptionally prolific, even given her remarkable longevity. She repeatedly investigated and revisited a number of subjects, forms, and materials over a 60- to 70-year period.nThough Wood did not turn to ceramics until 1933 at the age of 40, she became an accomplished clay artist and went on to produce some of her most notable works well into her 90s. Her experimentation with ceramic glazing and firing was extraordinary, a compendium of clay technique. She first began to experiment with clay pieces that took the form of tiles or plates. By the 1980s, Wood was creating objects on a much larger scale, such as colossal goblets more than a foot tall and wide. The exhibition will survey the full range of her ceramics from the miniature to the large-scale, from the utilitarian to the decorative, and from the vessel to figurative sculpture.nA fully-illustrated 144-page comprehensive catalog, published by the Santa Monica Museum of Art, accompanies the exhibition and offers a scholarly assessment of Beatrice Wood. This elegant publication includes 58 full-color plates, over 90 photographs, forward and acknowledgements by curators Elsa Longhauser and Lisa Melandri, original texts by Garth Clark, Kathleen Pyne and Jenni Sorkin, Wood s original diaries annotated and edited by Francis M. Naumann and Marie T. Keller, and a chronology by Lida M. Sunderland. The catalog s essays range from the examination of Wood s threshold position in early modernism, to her relationship with the Theosophical community in Ojai, as well as a technical evaluation of her work in clay. Wood began her life in art as a dilettante, and emerged a serious artist, nearly fifty years later. The accompanying writings illuminate the evolution of her work and document the art historical trajectory that delineates her vibrant contribution to the canon of Twentieth Century art.nWood created a complex, thoughtful, and inexhaustible oeuvre, one that is equal parts narrative and form, equal parts poetry and wit. Her irrepressible sensibility could be bold, audacious, insouciant, sexually charged, and at times biographical. This exhibition will honor Wood s indomitable spirit and dynamic artistic force, a pairing that produced a mature body of work that defines her importance as an artist.

SMMoA Executive Director Elsa Longhauser and Deputy Director Lisa Melandri are co-curators for the exhibition.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman is part of Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980. This unprecedented collaboration, initiated by the Getty, brings together more than sixty cultural institutions from across Southern California for six months beginning October 2011 to tell the story of the birth of the L.A. art scene. An artist who worked on both the East and West coasts and bridged gaps between areas as disparate as New York Dada and Southern California ceramics, Wood (1893-1998) was a vital contributor to the art scene of the period and is thus a key player in the Pacific Standard Time project.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman includes over 100 works of art. The exhibition begins with Wood s early Dada work, which includes drawings, paintings, posters, prints, and illustrated albums and travelogues. Wood first encountered Dada a primary creative and personal influence in New York, arising from her intimate friendships with Marcel Duchamp and the collectors Walter and Louise Arensberg. It was Dada that first inspired Wood to become an artist, and it shaped her creative thinking for the rest of her life. The exhibition also feature prominent examples of Wood s ceramics created from the 1940s until her death in 1998. Wood was exceptionally prolific, even given her remarkable longevity. She repeatedly investigated and revisited a number of subjects, forms, and materials over a 60- to 70-year period.nThough Wood did not turn to ceramics until 1933 at the age of 40, she became an accomplished clay artist and went on to produce some of her most notable works well into her 90s. Her experimentation with ceramic glazing and firing was extraordinary, a compendium of clay technique. She first began to experiment with clay pieces that took the form of tiles or plates. By the 1980s, Wood was creating objects on a much larger scale, such as colossal goblets more than a foot tall and wide. The exhibition will survey the full range of her ceramics from the miniature to the large-scale, from the utilitarian to the decorative, and from the vessel to figurative sculpture.nA fully-illustrated 144-page comprehensive catalog, published by the Santa Monica Museum of Art, accompanies the exhibition and offers a scholarly assessment of Beatrice Wood. This elegant publication includes 58 full-color plates, over 90 photographs, forward and acknowledgements by curators Elsa Longhauser and Lisa Melandri, original texts by Garth Clark, Kathleen Pyne and Jenni Sorkin, Wood s original diaries annotated and edited by Francis M. Naumann and Marie T. Keller, and a chronology by Lida M. Sunderland. The catalog s essays range from the examination of Wood s threshold position in early modernism, to her relationship with the Theosophical community in Ojai, as well as a technical evaluation of her work in clay. Wood began her life in art as a dilettante, and emerged a serious artist, nearly fifty years later. The accompanying writings illuminate the evolution of her work and document the art historical trajectory that delineates her vibrant contribution to the canon of Twentieth Century art.nWood created a complex, thoughtful, and inexhaustible oeuvre, one that is equal parts narrative and form, equal parts poetry and wit. Her irrepressible sensibility could be bold, audacious, insouciant, sexually charged, and at times biographical. This exhibition will honor Wood s indomitable spirit and dynamic artistic force, a pairing that produced a mature body of work that defines her importance as an artist.

SMMoA Executive Director Elsa Longhauser and Deputy Director Lisa Melandri are co-curators for the exhibition.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman is part of Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980. This unprecedented collaboration, initiated by the Getty, brings together more than sixty cultural institutions from across Southern California for six months beginning October 2011 to tell the story of the birth of the L.A. art scene. An artist who worked on both the East and West coasts and bridged gaps between areas as disparate as New York Dada and Southern California ceramics, Wood (1893-1998) was a vital contributor to the art scene of the period and is thus a key player in the Pacific Standard Time project.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman includes over 100 works of art. The exhibition begins with Wood s early Dada work, which includes drawings, paintings, posters, prints, and illustrated albums and travelogues. Wood first encountered Dada a primary creative and personal influence in New York, arising from her intimate friendships with Marcel Duchamp and the collectors Walter and Louise Arensberg. It was Dada that first inspired Wood to become an artist, and it shaped her creative thinking for the rest of her life. The exhibition also feature prominent examples of Wood s ceramics created from the 1940s until her death in 1998. Wood was exceptionally prolific, even given her remarkable longevity. She repeatedly investigated and revisited a number of subjects, forms, and materials over a 60- to 70-year period.nThough Wood did not turn to ceramics until 1933 at the age of 40, she became an accomplished clay artist and went on to produce some of her most notable works well into her 90s. Her experimentation with ceramic glazing and firing was extraordinary, a compendium of clay technique. She first began to experiment with clay pieces that took the form of tiles or plates. By the 1980s, Wood was creating objects on a much larger scale, such as colossal goblets more than a foot tall and wide. The exhibition will survey the full range of her ceramics from the miniature to the large-scale, from the utilitarian to the decorative, and from the vessel to figurative sculpture.nA fully-illustrated 144-page comprehensive catalog, published by the Santa Monica Museum of Art, accompanies the exhibition and offers a scholarly assessment of Beatrice Wood. This elegant publication includes 58 full-color plates, over 90 photographs, forward and acknowledgements by curators Elsa Longhauser and Lisa Melandri, original texts by Garth Clark, Kathleen Pyne and Jenni Sorkin, Wood s original diaries annotated and edited by Francis M. Naumann and Marie T. Keller, and a chronology by Lida M. Sunderland. The catalog s essays range from the examination of Wood s threshold position in early modernism, to her relationship with the Theosophical community in Ojai, as well as a technical evaluation of her work in clay. Wood began her life in art as a dilettante, and emerged a serious artist, nearly fifty years later. The accompanying writings illuminate the evolution of her work and document the art historical trajectory that delineates her vibrant contribution to the canon of Twentieth Century art.nWood created a complex, thoughtful, and inexhaustible oeuvre, one that is equal parts narrative and form, equal parts poetry and wit. Her irrepressible sensibility could be bold, audacious, insouciant, sexually charged, and at times biographical. This exhibition will honor Wood s indomitable spirit and dynamic artistic force, a pairing that produced a mature body of work that defines her importance as an artist.

Brambilla s oeuvre consists of complex video installations. Much of his work comprises found film footage edited, layered, and spliced to create compelling new narratives and stunning visual mosaics. With exquisite technical production and seamless editing, Brambilla s multi-layered tableaux of interconnecting images and looped video blend into an expansive landscape that forms his hallmark style.nThe exhibition at SMMoA will feature the premier of Evolution (Megaplex), 2010, a new large-scale 3D video collage, which displays the history of humankind through the lens of cinema. In this never before seen work, Brambilla combines hundreds of clips from genre films that re-enact historical moments as grand spectacle. This cacophony of images is looped and mapped into an infinite three-dimensional environment that scrolls horizontally across time. Evolution emphasizes conflicts through the ages, in a remix that seamlessly moves through past, present, and future, providing a satirical take on the bombast of the big-budget  epic. nIn a poignant work from 2002 titled HalfLife, Brambilla juxtaposes surveillance footage of gamers playing the then-popular video game Counter-Strike with live-feed footage of the game they are playing. By placing the young men in the  cross-hairs  point-of-view while simultaneously capturing their virtual actions inside the game-world, Brambilla highlights the physical displacement and the psychological dislocation inherent in entering the digital world.nCathedral, 2008, in which Brambilla filmed Christmas shoppers in a Canadian mall, exposes raw footage in a long and slow sequence of kaleidoscopic patterning. The superimposed and multi-layered images transform the mall into a hallucinatory space. Though it resembles an animated stained glass window, the work depicts commerce and conspicuous consumption, and the conflation of a  shoppers  paradise  with a literal place of worship.nBrambilla s Civilization (Megaplex), 2008, is dense with imagery and depicts heaven, hell, and in-between, in an epic, almost Dante-esque style, set to an excerpt from Stravinsky s Rite of Spring.�?His first  video mural  integrates clips into an expansive landscape that continuously scrolls downward, starting with the fires of hell, progressing through to celestial reward.

Brambilla s oeuvre consists of complex video installations. Much of his work comprises found film footage edited, layered, and spliced to create compelling new narratives and stunning visual mosaics. With exquisite technical production and seamless editing, Brambilla s multi-layered tableaux of interconnecting images and looped video blend into an expansive landscape that forms his hallmark style.nThe exhibition at SMMoA will feature the premier of Evolution (Megaplex), 2010, a new large-scale 3D video collage, which displays the history of humankind through the lens of cinema. In this never before seen work, Brambilla combines hundreds of clips from genre films that re-enact historical moments as grand spectacle. This cacophony of images is looped and mapped into an infinite three-dimensional environment that scrolls horizontally across time. Evolution emphasizes conflicts through the ages, in a remix that seamlessly moves through past, present, and future, providing a satirical take on the bombast of the big-budget  epic. nIn a poignant work from 2002 titled HalfLife, Brambilla juxtaposes surveillance footage of gamers playing the then-popular video game Counter-Strike with live-feed footage of the game they are playing. By placing the young men in the  cross-hairs  point-of-view while simultaneously capturing their virtual actions inside the game-world, Brambilla highlights the physical displacement and the psychological dislocation inherent in entering the digital world.nCathedral, 2008, in which Brambilla filmed Christmas shoppers in a Canadian mall, exposes raw footage in a long and slow sequence of kaleidoscopic patterning. The superimposed and multi-layered images transform the mall into a hallucinatory space. Though it resembles an animated stained glass window, the work depicts commerce and conspicuous consumption, and the conflation of a  shoppers  paradise  with a literal place of worship.nBrambilla s Civilization (Megaplex), 2008, is dense with imagery and depicts heaven, hell, and in-between, in an epic, almost Dante-esque style, set to an excerpt from Stravinsky s Rite of Spring.�?His first  video mural  integrates clips into an expansive landscape that continuously scrolls downward, starting with the fires of hell, progressing through to celestial reward.

The exhibition features two major series in Taylor s vast oeuvre: Wire Instruments (1989-1990) and Pet Stains (1989-1992). These distinctive bodies of work will illustrate the importance of Taylor s process and creative breadth.nTaylor was born in Springfield, Missouri in 1948. He studied at the Kansas City Art Institute and moved to New York in 1970, where he lived and worked until his death at the age of 51 from lung cancer in 1999. Taylor worked for many years as studio assistant to Robert Rauschenberg (where he met his future wife Debbie) and was acquainted with such burgeoning luminaries as James Rosenquist, Cy Twombly, and Brice Marden. Although these relationships nourished Taylor s abundant talent, his future work was inspired but not defined by these friendships. Out of financial necessity, he scavenged art materials from the street. His connection with the commonplace which remained unpredictable and deep resulted in a body of work that is singular, inventive, and eloquent.nTaylor began his studio practice as a painter in the seventies and early eighties. By 1985, however, he had developed a unique approach to process that encompassed a synergistic relationship between two-dimensional drawings and three-dimensional assemblages. Taylor s goal was to create a new way to experience and envision space; the works from this period helped him refine his investigations of visual perception across several dimensions.  Al felt that his work was research into vision,  says Debbie Taylor.  His work is really about looking, but he used everything around him. Seeing something could lead him to making one of these pieces, that could combine with something that he d read that morning, or with some music playing on the stereo, or with something on TV. Any of those things could inspire him. nTaylor made no distinction between his three-dimensional constructions and his drawings. Dismissing the term  sculpture,  he preferred to see the 3-D work as  drawing in space.  Fashioned from such simple elements as wooden broomsticks, wire, carpentry remnants, and other ephemera, his constructions offer a multitude of distinct points of view. Taylor s drawings, in fact, often inspired the development of his three-dimensional works, which he created as an extension, in order to  see more.  Taylor remarked that  [the work] isn t at all about sculptural concerns; it comes from a flatter set of traditions. What I am really after is finding a way to make a group of drawings that you can look around. Like a pool player, I want to have all the angles covered. nThe drawings and constructions titled Wire Instruments show Taylor experimenting with the simplest variations of geometric form (especially the triangle). These fragile ink, pencil, and gouache drawings and wood and wire constructions have not been the focus of any previous exhibitions or scholarly investigation. Their simplicity and ephemeral beauty provide a poignant glimpse into Taylor s creative production.nThe body of work called Pet Stains (which includes Pet Stains, Pet Names, Pet Stain Removal Devices, and the Peabody Group) portrays sensuous, abstract imagery of drop-like puddles, formulated with toner, paint, or ink on paper. The constructions in this series are made from wood and Plexiglas that is dribbled and dripped with paint of every viscosity. In this series, Taylor transformed patterns of dog urine on an urban sidewalk into art. The playful ease and subtle humor of these works is apparent: various pee-stains are often tagged with imaginary names of the dogs/artists who made them Buddy, Norman, Getty, Goya, and Everready or, with a nod to Duchamp, given such titles as Puddle Descending a Staircase, and so on. Again, as in Wire Instruments, permutation and variation on the theme is integral to his process how many pet names, how many puddles of pee can he transform into nuanced drawings or quirky constructions.nWire Instruments and Pet Stains will include 47 works. Connie Butler, The Robert Lehman Foundation Chief Curator of Drawings at the Museum of Modern Art, will contribute a major essay to accompany the exhibition.nMajor support for the exhibition is generously provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation. Additional support is provided by the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation, Susan and Leonard Nimoy, and David Zwirner, New York.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

For almost as long, one of the greatest urban legends in all of California history has been the Tijuana donkey show, the much-rumored, often-referenced, but never proven south of the border sex show that is perpetually re-invented in American high school locker rooms. The Donkey Show explores the border s intersection of myth and reality through a blend of over 200 rare tourist photographs, vintage nightlife ephemera, and pop songs born of American myths of Tijuana. The exhibition is guest curated by cultural anthropologist and graphic design historian Jim Heimann and author and music critic Josh Kun.nThe Donkey Show, one of the greatest urban legends in all of border history has been a key narrative of the American tourist since WWII. It has been referenced in songs, Hollywood films, and for decades has lurked in the dark corners of American fantasies about what lies just below the borderline-that capital of boundless vice and sombrero-clad savagery where morals drown in tequila, men offer their wives and sisters for the right price, and where only the taxi drivers (those tour guides of the forbidden) know the way to the donkey show. The myth of the donkey show proliferated as Tijuana s reputation as a den of ill repute grew in the American mind, from U.S. sex comics such as Tijuana Bibles and early U.S. smut films set in Tijuana, to local burlesque and prostitution houses. The trip to Tijuana soon became a rite of passage for California teenagers, memorialized in movies such as Big Wednesday and Losin  It (which featured Tom Cruise leading the Tijuana charge) and TV shows such as Moesha and The OC.nThe other donkey is the one that the millions of tourists who ve visited Tijuana actually get to know. That donkey is the one they sit on top of wearing sombreros lettered with  Just Married,   On My Ass,  and  Still Drunk  in front of a painted backdrop of  Old Mexico,  posing for souvenir photographs snapped by the Mexican entrepreneurs who ve been putting smiling Americans atop donkeys-day in, day out-since the turn of the 20th century. That donkey is a source of local business; that donkey is a local joke on American tourists looking for  the real thing  and getting Mexican make-believe.nBeginning in the late 1880s, Tijuana was fertile soil for American investment and American tourism, an early hub of hot springs, horse races, casinos and bullfights that exploded once Prohibition went into effect. American newspaper, railroad, and entertainment moguls poured money into the small dusty town (in 1900, Tijuana had a population of only 242) that was a short carriage ride from San Diego, creating a haven for vices unattainable on the opposite side of the border. Americans crossed the border to lose themselves in a fun house of racial stereotypes, seeing  native dances  and cock fights, donning serapes and sombreros, and posing with donkeys before they headed back home. It didn t take long for Tjuana locals to start cashing in on the distortions that Americans were expecting to find, giving the tourists want they wanted to see:  old Mexico,   the sleepy Mexican,  the Spanish se帽orita, the fat mustachioed bandido. By 1938, the Mexicans who ran the donkey cart photo stands began to paint black stripes on their animal stars so they could be better seen on the increasingly inferior film stock. Ever since, not only have millions of tourists sat on top of donkeys posing as  Mexicans,  they ve sat on top of  zonkeys  posing as  Mexicans. nThe striped donkey has become something of an official Tijuana mascot, lending its name and image to local bars, local industry, and as of 2010, even to a new city basketball team (Los Zonkeys).  The striped donkey is characteristic of the city,  Tijuana journalist Aida Silva Hernandez once wrote,  It is the history of Tijuana. nThe Donkey Show assembles over 200 tourist donkey cart photos from the early 1900s-1980s (one that even includes F. Scott Fitzgerald), alongside rare Tijuana nightlife, burlesque, and vice ephemera. The images are joined by a soundtrack culled from dozens of US pop, rock, and blues songs about the imaginary Mexico that awaits American tourists once they head south of the border. Like the donkey show of legend, The Donkey Show plays with the power of the border s bait and switch: the show promises the forbidden but delivers cultural history and critique.nWhat has driven millions of Americans of all backgrounds-white, Black, Latino, young, old-to have their picture taken on a donkey for well over a century? How have Mexican entrepreneurs turned American myth into local business and local culture? In a photo of a tourist and a donkey, which one is the ass?nAnd most importantly, how do you get to the donkey show?nBiographies of the guest curators:nJim Heimann is a cultural anthropologist and graphic design historian who is Executive Editor for TASCHEN America. He is the author of numerous books on architecture, pop culture, and the history of the West Coast, Los Angeles and Hollywood. The Donkey Show draws heavily from his private collection of ephemera that has been featured in museum exhibitions around the world and in dozens of books.nJosh Kun is an author, music critic, and professor in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California, where he directs the Popular Music Project of The Norman Lear Center. He has taught and written extensively on the cultural worlds connecting Southern California and Tijuana, Mexico.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Cummings (b. 1980) is a graduate of the MFA program at UCLA in sculpture, where he transferred his interest in 3-dimensional objects to painting. His abstract work plays with space and color in a variety of scales. The result: Deceptively simple, formal compositions that belie complex figure/ground relationships.nThis exhibition will feature six new works that investigate surface and pictorial depth, as well as the space between abstraction and figuration. In works like Metro, figures seem to emerge from shadowy environments, alluding to deep space and movement. Works like Untitled-with its central, ghostly, soft pink blur placed on background shapes in orange, blue, white, and black-deftly combine loose and semi-transparent washes with carefully wrought pictorial structure. Born in Pittsburgh, he lives and works in Los Angeles.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

The artist s book is extremely varied in the imagery, language, medium, and content embraced by its author and the wide range of examples selected for this exhibition emphasizes the possibilities of the genre. In many instances, in fact, the included works do not conform to the traditional structure of a book, or, for that matter, to any conventional art object. They are a hybrid form: book/art/object. Conceived as a complement to Combustione: Alberto Burri and America, Libro/Oggetto features works by Burri s contemporaries and successors, creating a contextual framework for his production.nLibro/Oggetto includes work by 49 artists working in a wide array of artistic movements. For example, the Visual Poetry artists of the 1960s and  70s used the book inventively to explore the combination of text and image. Arte Povera, which erupted from within a consumer society marked by mass production, sought to create work with  poor means.  For these artists, the book became a vehicle for constructing a new, raw visual vocabulary with everyday materials. During the late 1970s and early  80s, the Transavanguardia movement dramatically expanded the definition of painting. For those artists, the book was the perfect format in which to show their new brand of figuration and narrative.nA generation of young artists continues to work with this form, expanding upon the trails blazed by their forebears. Libro/Oggetto illustrates the rich diversity inherent in the artist s book, revealing the artistic trends of Italian art over the past 50 years.nLibro/Oggetto: Italian Artists  Books 1960s-Now聽features works by: Giovanni Anselmo, Stefano Arienti, Mirella Bentivoglio, Alighiero Boetti, Alberto Burri, Luca Buvoli, Chiara Camoni, Paolo Canevari, Loriana Castano, Maurizio Cattelan, Sandro Chia, Giuseppe Chiari, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi, Gino de Dominicis, Nicola De Maria, Mario Diacono, Luciano Fabro, Giovanni Ferrario, Emilio Isgr�? Jannis Kounellis, Ketty La Rocca, Andrea Marescalchi, Amedeo Martegani, Luigia Martelloni, Fabio Mauri, Mario Merz, Eugenio Miccini, Bruno Munari, Maurizio Nannucci, Luigi Ontani, Pierpaolo Pagano, Mimmo Paladino, Luca Pancrazzi, Giulio Paolini, Claudio Parmiggiani, Pino Pascali, Giuseppe Penone, Luciano Perna, Lucia Pescador, Lamberto Pignotti, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Pedro Riz a Porta, Ettore Spalletti, Allessandra Spranzi, Mauro Staccioli, Ernesto Tatafiore, and Emilio Villa.nLibro/Oggetto: Italian Artists  Books 1960s-Now was organized by guest curators聽Giovanna Zamboni Paulis and Randi Malkin Steinberger.聽nSupport for the exhibition has been provided by Fondazione Azzurra. Additional support is provided by the Istituto Italiano di Cultura (IIC), Los Angeles.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Lord s work transforms sensation into physical form charged with emotion, reflection, physical identity, and personal history.nIn Lord s exhibition for SMMoA, elements from five series of works represent developments in his oeuvre from the 1990s to the present day. Breathing, biting, swallowing, tasting, smelling, listening, watching is a landmark series of forms (1992-1998) in which Lord transforms abstract sensation into material form by molding his own body into clay with repeated applications of his chest, teeth, neck, nostrils, ears and eyes. By using his body as a tool, he translates the senses hearing, seeing, tasting, feeling from their liminal states into tactile and visual objects. In another series round, modeling, marking, touching and holding, pressing and squeezing, palm, fist Lord explores the sculptural variations made by the actions and gestures of his hands.nIn untitled series (2004), Lord observes and rebuilds the ceramics of Paul Gauguin, who has been a pivotal influence for him since the 1970s. Lord s untitled series explores Gauguin s enigmatic narrative in clay, of figures emerging from a natural landscape or engaged in everyday activity.nMore recently in Whitworth (2009), Lord built a series of clay sculptures that record the monuments, landscapes and people of his birthplace Whitworth, in Lancashire, England. In these works he uses memory as a sense in itself, giving it three-dimensional form. By imbuing the act of remembering with corporeal potential, Lord creates a sculptural map of the town, navigating his personal history through the recognizable landmarks of Whitworth s geography. Lord is also creating river Spodden at Healey Dell, a new series of plaster and beeswax sculptures that depict abstracted elements of the river on its rocky course through Whitworth. A video of the same name, made in 2008, accompanies the sculptures.nLord studied at Rochdale College of Art, England and later at the Central School of Art and Design, London. His work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam; and The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA. Lord has had solo exhibitions at Galerie Art   Project, Amsterdam; The Carnegie Museum of Art; Camden Arts Centre, London; and Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Enschede. His work has been included in Westkunst-Heute at the Museen dr Stadt, K枚ln; the 1995 Whitney Biennial; Site and Insight at PS1, New York; and The Third Mind at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.nSMMoA is collaborating with Milton Keynes Gallery in England on the production of a major catalogue that features an interview between Lord and James Rondeau (Curator, Frances and Thomas Dittmer Chair of Contemporary Art, The Art Institute of Chicago), and an essay by independent curator and scholar, Linda Norden. The combined exhibitions at SMMoA and Milton Keynes Gallery will comprise a comprehensive survey of Lord s work.nThe exhibition curator for Andrew Lord: between my hands to water falling, selected works from 1990 to 2010 is Elsa Longhauser, SMMoA Executive Director.nMajor support is generously provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Abby Sher, the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation, and Gladstone Galleryn\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

His company L Design was founded with partner, graphic designer Pippo Lionni, and encompasses product development, packaging, signage, visual identity, lighting, store and interior design. Their strikingly creative projects in lighting and furniture are produced for Ligne Roset, L`Oreal, Boucheron, Renault, and Vitra.nLevy`s work for SMMoA`s Project Room consists of two flower-like chandeliers, one red, one blue, made of very thin fluorescent tubes and hanging from a long wire. These fragile, tiny, bulbs hang over a stainless steel table in the form of a log, reflecting off its facets the colored light of the chandeliers above.nAfter attending Art Center Europe in Switzerland where he studied the history of design, Levy received a diploma in industrial design in 1991. He is also the winner of the Seiko Epson Inc. contest. Levy participated in the 2005 group exhibition at MoMA, Safe: Design Takes on Risk with his bulletproof jacket made from swan feathers, garnering accolades from within the international design community.�?As a designer, technician, artist, photographer, and filmmaker, Levy`s multi-disciplinary skills have been shown in prestigious galleries and museums worldwide, including Wright20 Gallery, Chicago; Moss Gallery, New York; Victoria   Albert Museum, London; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; the Israel Museum in Jerusalem; and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.nSupport for the exhibition is generously provided by The Philip and Muriel Berman Foundation.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

This year, SMMoA s Park Studio collaborates with the LA Opera for Ring Festival LA, which runs from April 15 to June 30, 2010. An exhibition of student work inspired by the themes of Richard Wagner s opera, Der Ring des Nibelungen, entitled Park Studio: RING, will be on view at SMMoA from May 15 through August 21, 2010. Park Studio is developed and organized by Asuka Hisa, SMMoA`s Director of Education.nThis summer, LA Opera unveils the first complete performances of Richard Wagner`s Ring Cycle ever presented in Los Angeles. In celebration of this monumental event, LA Opera has joined forces with Los Angeles  cultural and educational institutions to stage the first significant citywide cultural festival since the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival. SMMoA s partnership with the LA Opera for Ring Festival LA aligns with the goals of the Park Studio program.nFor Park Studio: RING, approximately twenty high school students will learn about Richard Wagner s seminal work and explore the symbolism of the ring in the opera power, jealousy, desire which has parallels in today s culture. They will participate in Ring Cycle discussions with SMMoA s educators, collaborating artists, and guest speakers, visit the backstage of the LA Opera, and enjoy a dress rehearsal of G枚tterd盲mmerung. Finally, with the help of environmental artist Gordon Bowen and his Arts ReFoundry Atelier (a portable foundry made completely from recycled materials), students will interpret the meaning and power of the ring to cast their own original bronze ring-shaped sculptures. The exhibition of the student s bronze works will be displayed at SMMoA from May 15 to August 21, 2010.nPark Studio takes interdisciplinary art education outside museum walls and into the community. This free program is held annually during the spring break, when contemporary artists lead workshops, art history lessons, and field trips to cultural sites. Park Studio is open to high school students residing or attending school in the Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District. Students enrolled at Santa Monica`s Olympic High School, a continuation school, may receive a full semester credit toward earning their high school diploma. SMMoA presents this program in partnership with the City of Santa Monica Cultural Affairs Department and the Teen Center at Virginia Avenue Park.nFor over 10 years, Park Studio has provided unforgettable and formative experiences for teens. Through transformative experiences of art making and collaboration with established artists and organizations, participants gain access to ideas and opportunities that have the potential to shape their adult lives.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Between Science and Magic is a simple, and beautiful, interpretation of  movie magic -a century-old expression that still conjures the mythology of Hollywood filmmaking. Thater s project is conceived as a brief history of cinema.nThater s new and innovatory piece recreates, and repositions, a seminal moment in Los Angeles history, when downtown LA was being dreamed into a gilded metropolis and a theater district was built to rival New York s Great White Way. Renowned magician Greg Wilson appears as if filmed within the famed Los Angeles Theatre, the most elaborate of the movie palaces built between 1911 and 1931 on Los Angeles s now-defunct  theater row.  Thus, the viewer experiences a palpable tension between past and present. The repeated performance of an archetypal magic trick-pulling a rabbit out of a hat-is captured in tones of black, white, and grey; only the magician s skin tone and the rabbit s eyes have a trace of color.nA pioneering filmmaker, Thater s work is held in many public collections including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate, London; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She has been the subject of solo exhibitions at such prestigious institutions as the Vienna Secession; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Kunsthalle Basel; and The Renaissance Society, Chicago. Most recently, Thater s gorillagorillagorilla-a poignant study of human and animal behavior-was premiered at the Kunsthaus Graz, in collaboration with the Museum of Natural History in London, to celebrate the bicentenary of Charles Darwin s birth. Between Science and Magic is Thater s first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in over 10 years.nSupport for the exhibition is generously provided by The Broad Art Foundation, The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation, and The Suzanne Nora Johnson and David Gordon Johnson Foundation.nn\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

His video projections are participatory performances that use light, time and optics to create an element of surprise. For Seeing While Seeing, Wells will create a series of new, site-specific, projected works that mimic a variety of visual phenomena from after-effects and aura to color and shape-shifts the room will literally come alive with his animated projections. Each work makes you question whether what you see is real or is just an animated effect.nWells received his M.F.A from UCLA in 2006, and lives and works in Joshua Tree, California.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

In most cases, public access to these neighborhoods is blocked by means of temporary barriers, which remain closed for 24 hours thus creating an artificial border between the orthodox areas and the rest of the city. The barriers are put in place by neighborhood residents, with the approval and support of the Jerusalem municipality and the police. The city therefore becomes topologically transformed into two cities one with and one without cars. Although the value of these somewhat rickety barriers may appear symbolic, their presence is sometimes a source of friction and conflict; they delineate a clear cut boundary between the sacred and the everyday. Pereg s subject matter is often full of political tension, but in Sabbath 2008, she has created a film that is objective in offering a documentary view of an important aspect of religious Jewish life.nPereg was born in Israel in 1969, and now lives in Israel and Germany. She received her B.F.A from Cooper Union in New York, and graduated from the Bezalel M.F.A studio program in Jerusalem. Her works have been exhibited at such venues as PS 1 New York; HDK Berlin; ZKM Karlsruhe; the Israel Museum in Jerusalem; Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art; Liverpool Biennial, England (2006); and Loop Video-Art Fair, Barcelona, Spain (2006).nNira Pereg: Sabbath 2008 has been supported in part by The Jewish Federation s Tel Aviv/Los Angeles Partnership.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Its basic premise was to invite international and out-of-state artists to phone instructions that would be executed bymuseum installers. Schoenstadt and McBride have created their  exchange  as a variation of the 1969 project, with each phoning the other with instructions for a work. At SMMoA, Schoenstadt will create McBride s work according to the instructions   photographs of all the gas stations along California Highway 1 between Los Angeles International Airport and Point Dume. McBride was asked by Schoenstadt to choose a discarded drawing from her studio and load it into a fax machine, then ask the Gallery to fax the floor plans of their proposed exhibition space. The combination of interposed drawing and architectural plan provided the final composition. This work was shown at New York gallery Alexander and Bonin from May 9 through June 13, 2009.nThe project takes up the  telephone game  idea of transforming visual information into language and back to visual, and also embraces the conceptual promise that  anyone  can make an art work based on the idea of the systemic production of art according to instruction. In the current era of instant messaging and social media, Schoenstadt and McBride use the telephone as a means of communication to initiate their conceptual works that explore the ramifications of what happens when an artist gives up control over his or her project. With its focus on collaboration and exploration of the nature of authorship, this exhibition is the perfect complement to the Allen Ruppersberg exhibition, which runs concurrently at SMMoA.nSchoenstadt received a BFA from Pitzer College, California, and has participated in many solo and two-person exhibitions and projects in Europe and the U.S., including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and the Institute of Contemporary Art, London. Her body of work centers around the exploration of drawing, and frequently includes series in which the final product is arrived at by chance or by instructions provided either via the audience or other artists; her works are often site-specific. Schoenstadt lives and works in Venice, California.nMcBride received a BA from Bard College, New York, and an MFA from California Institute of the Arts, Valencia. She is the recipient of many awards and residencies, including the prestigious Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2002). Her projects vary greatly from unorthodox books to large-scale sculptures. Her work has been shown at the SculptureCenter, New York, and she has had several solo museum exhibitions throughout Europe. McBride lives and works in D眉sseldorf, Germany where she is a professor at the Kunstakademie D眉sseldorf.nThe catalog accompanying the project is a recording of each artist s instructions on a vinyl record, just as it was for the original 1969聽Art By Telephone. The record will be playing in the Project Room as part of the installation; a limited edition of signed copies will be available for sale.聽Tell Me Something Good: A Collaboration between Kim Schoenstadt and Rita McBride聽is organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art and curator Lisa Melandri, Deputy Director for Exhibitions and Programs.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

New forms are accompanied and supported by materials such as wood, MDF, 2x3s, digital photographs, metal, glaze, enamel, and drawing materials.nCherubini s work brings antiquated notions of ceramics into a contemporary sculptural discourse as they invoke ideas rooted in conceptual art from the 1970s. The new  box  pieces presented at SMMoA come from a continued interest by Cherubini in movement, process, containment, and structure. These sculptures reference the cardboard pieces of Robert Rauschenberg, the material use of Robert Morris, ideas about physical space addressed by Donald Judd, and Eva Hesse s ability to challenge the 2-D and 3-D.nCherubini s large container is based on a Greek storage vessel from 500BC in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Made of clay in multiple sections, it has no base and is filled with holes in defiance of its function. Barely glazed, most of its surface is raw, exposed, dry clay.nAttached to this sculpture is a framed manipulated digital c-print of an 18th Century watercolor of The Portland Vase by T. Hosner Shepard. This vase, in the collection of The British Museum, London, was famously broken in February 1845 by an Irish university drop-out, William Mulcahy, who destroyed the vitrine and smashed the vase with a stone sculpture displayed nearby. Cherubini has drawn over this image with paint, graphite, and ink, depicting the shards before the piece was reconstructed.nCherubini uses the cardboard box in which manufactured clay comes as a mold for an object placed on a tall pedestal base. The collapsed, flaccid  box  is turned on its flattened side, adorned with pools and drips of glaze. Marks created by the mold and finger fully illustrate the process of its making, exposing both inside and out to the viewer.nA large plywood pilaster, full of knots and cracks, displays brightly glazed hanging terracotta  boxes . These are glazed with intense semi-precious colors of lapis, turquoise, malachite, cobalt, and rose quartz. Their earthy and organic textures vary from high gloss to matte, and are texturized with shimmery sediment and crystals mixing in the firing process. A larger 5-sided clay  box  stands on its side nearby, made from white clay with a matte white glaze.nCherubini was born in Boston in 1970. She received her BFA in Ceramics from the Rhode Island School of Design and her MFA in Visual Arts from New York University, and later attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. She is a recipient of an NEA Travel Grant, a New England Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Sculpture, the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award, and most recently an Art Matters Grant for travel in Mexico. Her work has been exhibited in group and solo exhibitions both internationally and in the United States; including the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, Santa Barbara, CA; Sculpture Center, New York; La Panader铆a, Mexico City; PS1/MoMA, New York; The Rose Art Museum, Boston; Samson Projects, Boston; and Galerie Michael Janssen, Berlin. Last fall, she had concurrent exhibitions at Smith Stewart Gallery and D Amelio Terras in New York. Cherubini lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.nNicole Cherubini is organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art and curator Lisa Melandri, Deputy Director for Exhibitions and Programs.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Al is a  vernacular anthropologist  whose artistic interests and sensibilities have been indelibly shaped by the spirit and ethos of Southern California. nRuppersberg s vast oeuvre includes paintings, prints, photographs, sculptures, installations and books that explore the intersection of art, literature, and life. His work is often participatory, like that of Allan Kaprow and others, and he finds source material in the everyday. Ruppersberg s vast collection of early to mid-twentieth-century cultural ephemera-which includes calendars, snapshots, magazines, comic books, newspaper clippings, postcards, posters, and instructional films-form the basis of much of his recent work.nAs a teacher and artist, Ruppersberg has also influenced several Los Angeles artists of the generation following his, including, most notably, Jim Shaw and Mike Kelley, whose works also deal with the American vernacular. East Coast artist Rachel Harrison, who incorporates a deluge of cultural debris in her sculptures-celebrity magazines, costume jewelry, canned goods, and wigs-has acknowledged Ruppersberg s importance in the development of her own work. Ruppersberg has always had a strong, independent vision shaped first by growing up in America s heartland and also by spending months and years living and working in New York and Europe, where his work has been shown in an array of major museums.nTwo new large-scale installations in this exhibition continue to expand Ruppersberg s use of imagery culled from his vast archive of twentieth-century ephemera.聽The Never Ending Book Part 2/Art and Therefore Ourselves�?2009), is a selection of more than 15,000 pages of Xeroxed images from the artist s book collection, installed in a stage-like environment made of theatrical props and early twentieth-century mural-sized vintage posters. The pages are stacked in approximately fifty small cardboard boxes designed by the artist. These duplicated pages are free for the taking. In this way, Ruppersberg makes his library available to each audience member who can subsequently create his or her own unique  book  to take home. As part of this project, Ruppersberg has created a 33 RPM vinyl LP record, which functions as an oral analog to the books on view. The record includes old songs and hymns, spoken word recordings, recipes read by poet Bill Berkson, and people singing around the piano, all dating from the early to mid-20th century.nFor the second installation,聽The Sound and the Story/The Hugo Ball Award for 20th Century Graphics�?2009), photocopied and laminated items of everyday ephemera from Ruppersberg s extensive collection are suspended from a wall of pegboards. Viewers are invited to rearrange the materials on the pegboard to create their own narrative. During the run of the exhibition, Ruppersberg will periodically respond to these arrangements by reorganizing the items himself, thus creating a visual conversation with his audience  co-producers. nThe exhibition also includes a selection of earlier collages and drawings-two-dimensional works from important series聽The Gift and the Inheritance�?1989), and聽Cover Art�?1985); both of which provide an historical backdrop to the new installations.nRuppersberg s work is held in major collections including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.聽He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and lives and works in Los Angeles and New York.nAllen Ruppersberg: You and Me or The Art of Give and Take聽is organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Guest curator of the exhibition is Constance Lewallen, Adjunct Curator at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.nThe publication that accompanies the exhibition was conceived by Ruppersberg as an artwork in itself, and is a cross between a traditional catalog and an artist s book. Based on a 1956 edition of travel guideThe Guest Informant,聽it is spiral-bound and cardboard-covered. The publication contains essays by renowned author and cultural critic, Greil Marcus, and guest curator Constance Lewallen, along with an interview with and commentary on the artist, random ephemera, and exhibition information. It is co-published by JRP|Ringier, Switzerland. The new vinyl LP record will also be available in a limited edition of 200.nMajor support for the exhibition and publication is provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional funding is provided by LLWW Foundation, the Frederick R. Weisman Philanthropic Foundation, the Pasadena Art Alliance, and Margo Leavin Gallery. Related programming is made possible in part by a grant from the City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Arts Commission, Emily Fisher Landau, Lenore and Bernard Greenberg, and Judy and Stuart Spence.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

While Hendricks has worked in a variety of media throughout his career, and has explored diverse subject matter, he is best known for his striking and provocative life-sized portraits of everyday African-American people from the urban northeast. Bringing to mind American realism, pop culture, and post-modernism in a way uniquely his own, Hendricks  pioneering contributions to African-American portraiture and conceptualism claims a compelling space somewhere between portraitists Chuck Close and Alex Katz, and African-American conceptualists David Hammons and Adrian Piper. At times cool, at times confrontational, sometimes sexually charged, and always empowering, the work reveals the artist s keen eye for his subject s attire, attitude, style, and point of view. Hendricks  groundbreaking body of work has both influenced and paved the way for many of today s generation of artists.nHendricks calls his camera his  mechanical sketchbook,  as many of his paintings are realized from photographs of people he encountered in daily life.nBirth of the Cool聽is organized by Trevor Schoonmaker, Curator of Contemporary Art at the聽http://www.nasher.duke.edu/exhibitions_hendricks.php聽in Durham, North Carolina.nThe exhibition catalog includes essays by Schoonmaker; Thelma Golden, Director and Chief Curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem; and Franklin Sirmans, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Menil Collection.nFollowing its presentation at SMMoA, the exhibition will travel to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston. It was also shown at the Studio Museum in Harlem.nBorn in Philadelphia, the artist studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts before receiving his B.F.A and M.F.A. at Yale University, where he studied with legendary photographer Walker Evans. He is currently a Professor of Art Studio at Connecticut College, in New London, Connecticut.nBirth of the Cool has been named one of聽Vogue Magazine s聽top 25 cultural events of the year.n nThe exhibition was organized by the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University.nThis exhibition is sponsored in part by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc., the National Endowment for the Arts, which believes that a great nation deserves great art, the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation, and the North Carolina Arts Council with funding from the State of North Carolina.nSupport for the presentation at SMMoA is generously provided by the Peter Norton Family Foundation on behalf of Eileen Harris Norton.

With a fresh and vivid palette, a reductive, cartoon-like figurative style with a metallic-like patina reminiscent of video game robots and characters, Kelly creates scenes that on closer inspection reveal a mixture of personal archetypes and classic racial stereotypes.nThe artist s aesthetic includes references to the figurative work of Jacob Lawrence and to the controversial stop motion animations of George Pal, especially聽John Henry and the Inky-Poo聽and the聽Jasperseries from the 1940s. Like Pal, Kelly utilizes the perception of race as a narrative device, something to work with and work against in the children s formation of identity through play.nKelly was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1980 and grew up in Arlington, Texas. He received his B.F.A. in Painting from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and his M.F.A. from Yale University.

Through her small canvases, the viewer is able to peer into another world, watching epic scenes play out with a surreal, impressionistic twist.nIn this exhibition, which includes new work, Spota fills her canvases with cramped figures engaged in frenzied activity, complete with choruses of angels, rows of haloed figures, and the Virgin floating, often repeatedly, in a mandorla, creating a heavy, purposeful yet intimate connection with the viewer that is rarely found in the Medieval and Renaissance pieces that her works recall. Other canvases are more abstract in their subject matter, as if she has cut and pasted detailed elements from her works to form a new composite. Don t Tread on Me features a new bronze cast of her paintings, perfectly underscoring Spota s attention to the construction of both narrative and surface.nAdopting the flattened pictorial space of medieval icons combined with the rich, globular application of paint, Spota creates an ecstatic, almost abstract surface through her brushstroke technique, in which paint is heaped on in indulgent, cake frosting-like daubs and layers.nSpota was born in New York and earned her B.F.A. at State University of New York at Purchase and her M.F.A. from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She lives and works in Los Angeles.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

In the West Coast debut of new paintings that explore the American condition,聽Arnold Mesches: Coming Attractions聽opens at the Santa Monica Museum of Art on January 24 and will be on view through April 18, 2009.nMesches  most recent work delves into dark periods of American history and situates them in a hauntingly contemporary landscape. His work combines an interest in twentieth century political and social conflicts with a surrealist approach to painting�?offsetting frank, historical moments with rich, melodramatic dreamscapes.nThis new exhibition of Mesches  work, curated by Lisa Melandri, SMMoA s Deputy Director for Exhibitions and Programs, and uniquely installed in two Project Rooms, will feature selections from his most recent series, including landscapes and interiors. Aptly titled,聽Coming Attractions聽alludes to the works  theatrical elements, as well as to a portent of what might be to come.nMesches  large-scale interiors and landscape canvases, are laden with acerbic colors and vigorous brushwork. In his interiors, Mesches fills opulent concert halls and antique salons with stark reminders of social and political realities, rendered in deep blacks, austere whites, and sickly greens against the blazing colors of their surroundings. Mesches  landscapes are similarly harrowing, depicting glimpses of human existence between the trunks of decaying trees. These canvases are portraits of a disturbing, looming future, both absurd and poignant, as well as emotionally authentic.nThe theatricality and grandeur of the paintings evoke Mesches  own history working in the movie industry during the 1940s and 50s in Los Angeles, and their skepticism and ominous sensibility harkens back to the 27 years he was subject to heavy scrutiny by the FBI for his participation in peace marches and demonstrations against McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Mesches eventually obtained his 760-page FBI file through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and turned dozens of the documents crisply typed white pages thick with black bars, dating from 1945 to 1972 into a popular and critically acclaimed art exhibition,聽The FBI Files.nThroughout his 60-plus-year career as an artist, Mesches has woven many narratives into lush and virtuosic paintings, and in聽Coming Attractions聽Mesches affirms that he is as potent as a painter and storyteller as ever. His life s work serves as a remarkable record of one artist s struggle to come to terms with the turmoil of the twentieth century. He has stood staunchly for using contemporary art as a vehicle for protest, a visual amplifier of societal good and evil.nComing Attractions聽also marks a homecoming for Mesches, who was born in the Bronx, grew up in Buffalo, New York, and moved to Los Angeles in 1943 to accept a scholarship at the Art Center School (now Art Center College of Design). Mesches spent nearly half his life in L.A., and came into his own here in the mid 1940s and into the 50s, becoming known and revered for his socially critical paintings and his portraits. He now resides in Gainesville, Florida. He is the recipient of many awards, including the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2002).nMesches has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and abroad in 125 solo exhibitions and countless group shows, and his works are included in many prestigious public and private collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Albright-Knox Museum, and the High Museum of Art. However, Mesches has still not received the global recognition or broad appreciation he so deserves for his influence and importance to the canon of contemporary art. As an antidote to this oversight, SMMoA will install Mesches  work in two Project Rooms, doubling the museum space normally allotted to such exhibitions.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

The exhibition, co-curated by Meskerem Assegued, a revered Ethiopian curator and anthropologist, and visionary theater, opera, and multi-disciplinary arts impresario, Peter Sellars, is comprised of more than 100 works in a variety of mediums, scale, and forms. A highlight of the exhibition is a series of striking thrones made of leather, wood, mud and straw, which will be integrated into conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen s final Los Angeles Philharmonic concerts staged by Sellars in mid-April.nElias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart聽will be accompanied by a film by award-winning filmmakers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) that will uniquely document the exhibition.nUsing yarn, plastics, tattered fabric, buttons, used plastic, and bottle tops, each of the collages and stitched canvases Sime creates for聽Elias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart聽represent a complete essay about the current state of his surroundings. Sime s three-dimensional sculptures are made with traditional organic Ethiopian building materials such as mud and straw, as well as wood, metal, and other found objects, gathered in part by neighborhood children.nIt was Sellars  passion for Sime s work that initially inspired SMMoA s executive director Elsa Longhauser to consider the idea of an exhibition of Sime s work. During their conversations, Sellars explained that Sime s thrones, designed to elevate and celebrate Ethiopia s street culture, so moved him that he was determined to feature the thrones in his production of Stravinsky s聽Oedipus Rex聽and聽Symphony of Psalms, Salonen s final concerts on April 16, 17, 18 and 19. Sime originally designed the thrones for Sellars  2006 New Crowned Hope Festival, a celebration of Mozart s 250th anniversary in Vienna, Austria.nIn聽Elias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart, the thrones make up part of the installation piece聽Min Neber, a new iteration of a series of works in which Sime addresses the dignity, wisdom and depth of the ancient indigenous cultures that are rapidly disappearing from Ethiopia. Also, displayed in a semicircle around a small ceremonial table, the installation will include five wall sculptures, made from wood, cans, leather, and stitches, as well as a short, silent video installation documenting indigenous religious practices of small villages in Ethiopia. In聽Mud and Straw, small mud and straw creatures take over the gallery space. A video installation documents Sime s construction of a Gota, the traditional grain storage container found in northern Ethiopia.nBIOGRAPHIES:nAs a child, Elias Sime taught himself to sew, embroider, and repair furniture. He collected cast-off objects and materials, such as flattened tin cans, and fashioned them into his own creations. Today Sime still collects energetically plastic shopping bags in different colors, plastic shoes, horns from slaughtered cattle and buys some of the raw material for his work, such as buttons, at the Mercato, Addis Abeba s sprawling central market. Just as he gathers materials for making art from the markets and streets, Sim�?finds the themes for his works in the streets of Addis. He documents the lives and portraits of Ethiopians living in the Cherkos Gebeya, Legaehar and Chide Terra areas surrounding Addis Abeba, where he finds most of his working materials. Sime has deep connections with the communities he documents, in particular with the neighborhood children who bring him objects they collect from the street.nBorn in Cherkos, outside of Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, Sime graduated from Addis Abeba University s School of Fine Art and Design with a degree in graphic design. His practice focuses mainly on collages, stitches, and three-dimensional sculpture. Sime has had numerous solo shows, and has participated in many group exhibitions including the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Peter Sellars  New Crowned Hope in Vienna, Austria; the Dak Art Biennale 2004, in Dakar, Senegal; and the Zoma Contemporary Art Center and the National Museum in Addis Ababa. Sim�?lives and works in Addis Ababa.nPeter Sellars, a director of opera, theatre and film, is renowned worldwide for his innovative treatments of classical material from western and non-western traditions, and for exploring the role of the performing arts in contemporary society and his commitment to spreading artistic vision to enact change. He has served as artistic director of the Los Angeles Festival, the American National Theatre at the Kennedy Center, the Boston Shakespeare Company and the Elitch Theatre for Children in Denver. Sellars is a professor in the department of World Arts and Cultures at UCLA, where he teaches Art as Social Action and Art as Moral Action. His past teaching positions include a visiting professorship at the Center for Theatre Arts at UC Berkeley. He resides in Los Angeles.nTrained as an anthropologist, Meskerem Assegued is the curator and founder of Addis Abeba s Zoma Contemporary Art Center. In 2006, she curated Green Flame in Vienna, Austria, part of the New Crowned Hope Festival, in which Sime participated. Assegued has served as a selection committee of the 2004 Dak Art Biennale, one of the largest contemporary art exhibitions in the world. In 2007, Assegued was on the selection committee for the African Pavilion in the 52nd Venice Biennale. She lives in Addis Abeba.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

I m an artist who uses photography when the idea dictates. And I think that s okay because I m also a performance artist who makes objects, or I m an object-maker who does performances. I think these labels are less important than the ability to go in the directions I d like for each work. n- Martin Kersels in conversation with Ian Berry, Associate Director, The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore CollegenFrom September 13 to December 13, 2008, Santa Monica Museum of Art presents聽Martin Kersels: Heavyweight Champion, the first retrospective of this influential and pioneering Southern California artist. Spanning the years from 1994 to 2007, the exhibition includes thirty-three multimedia artworks ranging from small sculptures, to large-scale photographs, to monumental installations. Kersels has long been esteemed in Southern California artistic and academic circles, and his work is in many collections worldwide. The advent of聽Heavyweight Champion聽marks a timely opportunity for this 2008 Guggenheim Foundation Fellow to enjoy the broader recognition and respect his work and creative achievements so well deserve.nKersels is a long-time aficionado of Buster Keaton, and on first encounter, his artwork seems to exude a similar deadpan slapstick style, balancing the humorous with the wistfully awkward. On further study, this initial impression gives way to darker layers; the performances and works reveal what Kersels refers to as  wink-wink humor mixed with a tragic element.  Early pieces, including the large-scale photographic series of Kersels falling, tripping, tossing people, and being smacked with assorted objects, find the artist experimenting with the creative possibilities of his 6-foot, 7-inch, 350 lb. frame. But the trajectory of Kersels  career as illuminated in聽Heavyweight Champion聽clearly indicates that he is not a single-issue artist; he is not, in the words of Ian Berry  the body-issue guy.  Particularly in his later work, the artist has gone in more conceptual directions, to explore themes of scale, time, space, sound, and gravity.nHighlights of聽Heavyweight Champion聽include the monumental installation聽Dionysian Stage�?2004-2005), a 14-foot-diameter nest that spins like an enormous, natural disco ball, and incorporates all manner of homey, domestic debris in its woven willow branches.

Pollock presents a series of seven 24  �?24  abstract oil paintings that are monochromatic explorations of a single subject matter. He has also created an expansive, site-specific wall drawing that offers a linear interpretation of the geometric scheme used in the paintings. Both the panoramic and the more compact works reveal the artist s fascination with mathematical systems and the recurring patterns and forms found in the natural world.nPollock animates the Project Room 2 space with fractal imagery, geometric structures, and circles, all in shifting levels of scale and density. The paintings are packed with ornate webs, honeycombs, and spirals, mimicking the logic of such organic forms as corals, mollusks, and plants. Each painting focuses on a limited color range; together the seven paintings comprise the spectrum of visible hues. The contrasting light and dark, warm and cool, and bright and dull color tones of these intense microcosms create the illusion of luminosity and deep space. The paint is applied in repeating fractal circles, producing shifting scales and intricate patterns that seem to change depending on the viewer s perspective. The wall drawing exudes a more free-flowing, outwardly directed energy. Its repeated system of patterns tumbles seemingly unimpeded towards all corners of the room, voraciously engulfing whatever surface it comes in contact with.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Designed, cut, and sewn by the artist, the nylon shelters take on a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and color combinations, and appear as idiosyncratic tents. From bifurcated and curvilinear structures to objects suggesting cutting-edge teepees, Busby s shelters include transparent sections, mesh windows, and even, in some cases, a central oculus that imparts a chapel-like environment, perfect for reflection and contemplation. The structures shield their users both physically and conceptually from the vices of the urban landscape. Though sturdy, tensile, and self-supporting, all of Busby s shelters are also completely collapsible and transportable, so that one s filtration system can be taken along and erected anywhere.nFor his first museum exhibition at SMMoA, Busby created an installation including a new large-scale shelter that is modular and can be attached to any number of other like structures through a system of quick-release buckles and zippers. While his shelters are structured around concepts of mobility and flexibility, Busby s new drawings have a geographic specificity. Included in the exhibition were a series of Busby s聽Creativity Amplification Quakes (CRAQUE)聽drawings, depicting intricate, billowing clouds of contamination rising from the actual fault lines of the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas. These lush, detailed renderings have a rich, almost baroque handling, belying a sinister, fluid, and pervading energy that rises from and swirls around the land. Busby began the series as a way to diagram and become intimately reacquainted with the simultaneously beautiful and dangerous California topography. By articulating the literal cracks within these particular landscapes, Busby links the work both to his Bay Area home and to the Santa Monica Museum of Art.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

While Condon s previous work was characterized by the subversive tactics of hacking and the intervention into commercial computer games,聽Judgment Modification聽revealed his shift to composing projected moving-image installations that function as animated paintings. These noninteractive  self-playing  games run continuously, like games waiting for the viewer to pick up the controller.nCondon s creative process is informed by the software hacking logic he learned directly from online and offline fan subcultures. In his work he often reinterprets historical events and existing artworks. Examples of this include a two-hour  Deathmatch  battle between medieval reenactors (Untitled War,�?004) at Machine Project; and a computer simulation of the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, featuring an AK47-wielding David Koresh (Waco Resurrection,�?003, a C-level collaboration). Trained as a sculptor, Condon uses technology as the raw material for his art, creating works that are both profound and playful.nCondon lived for a number of years in the Netherlands, where he had easy access to 15th-century European religious paintings. He believes that these works influence the visual style of games and fantasy art. He also believes that the catastrophic thinking these works reflect has greatly influenced the current political discourse.  The references to monsters and wars, the emergence of readings of the Bible, the distrust of science, the faith in religious structures to solve our problems, this type of pre-modern thinking is rooted in the late-Medieval period in northern Europe,  notes Condon.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

The exhibition s labyrinth of metal and wooden studs, which conformed to the original wall constructions, revealed how the noncollecting Museum a kunsthalle reinvents itself with each new exhibition. Asher s installation translated the historical infrastructure and museological process into visual form, highlighting what would otherwise remain seamlessly hidden. The skeletal frameworks illuminated what art historian Miwon Kwon describes as  the temporariness of the architecture of temporary exhibitions.  With this work at SMMoA, Asher continued his artistic practice of institutional critique uncovering the ways in which museums and galleries display and interpret art.nVisitors were able to view the installation from the front of the main gallery, as well as through a special entrance at the back of the museum. Project Room 2 served as a documentation room, containing floor plans for the 44 exhibitions, including the position of every wall and its exhibition provenance. In addition, a tear-away pair of handouts at the back of SMMoA allowed visitors to review all exhibition floor plans while traversing the installation.nMichael Asher is an internationally renowned pioneer of institutional critique and conceptual art. Since the mid-1960s he has explored how museums and other institutions frame the art experience for viewers and influence the cultural dialogue. His interventions use elements that exist or existed at the site. Asher has been featured at such important venues as the Art Institute of Chicago; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Documenta 5 and 7, Kassel, Germany; the Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland; the Kunstverein Hamburg, Germany; Le Consortium, Dijon, France; Le Nouveau Mus茅e, Villeurbanne, France; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Mus茅e d Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, France; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Skulptur Projekte, M眉nster, Germany; the Van Abbemuseum Eindhoven, the Netherlands; and the 39th International Art Biennale, in Venice, Italy.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Her subjects are purposefully stylized to call attention to the way their real-life counterparts have been portrayed in the popular media as mysterious, exotic, sexual, even animalistic beings. Its title inspired by the Santana song of the same name,聽Black Magic Woman聽depicted three contemporary Santeria priestesses practicing in a spooky landscape filled with creeping mist. As with traditional representations of saints, each was surrounded by attributes. One, situated in a graveyard, conjured zombies with a nail-punctured human heart, poison from a blowfish, and the miraculous little blue pills that aid in raising the dead. Another, adopting the posture of someone who constantly works on a car in the street, turned her junker into a flourishing witch s garden. The last stood at her vanity, casting spells and hoping to capture the one she loves with the help of a voodoo doll, perfume, and face powder a combination of Chanel and Hershey s Cocoa. In all three cases, Holland fashioned images of creative, resourceful women whose magic is a metaphor for using everyday materials to make the proverbial silk purse from a sow s ear. Her lush and detailed figurative paintings are simultaneously literal and allegorical; they combine the eerie quality of nineteenth-century ghost stories with the visual language of a hip-hop music video. Black Magic Woman also alluded to a theatrical stage set, calling further attention to the artificial construction of the stereotypes it portrayed.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .
