        "Description": "When Vice President Chester Arthur succeeded to the presidency on the death of James Garfield, a newspaper noted that he was \"not a man who would have entered anybody's mind\" as a worthy candidate for the office. Indeed, as a major player in a spoils system that reduced the civil service to a vehicle for rewarding party faithful, he struck many as an emblem of all that was wrong in American politics. As president, however, Arthur rose above his past to promote landmark legislation designed to curb the spoils system. He also proved to be a foe of other forms of corruption. When, for example, a \"pork barrel\" bill for public improvements reached his desk, he vetoed it.  This head-and-shoulders portrait can only hint at the fashionable figure that Arthur cut. With his muttonchop whiskers \"trimmed to the perfection point\" and his suits made of only the finest fabrics, he invariably looked like the very epitome of the well-bred Victorian gentleman. ",

His great dream was for a canal linking the Great Lakes with the Hudson River. When expected federal financing did not materialize, Clinton set out to put public pressure for funding on the state legislature. A bond issue was approved just in time for Clinton, newly elected as governor, to preside over the groundbreaking ceremonies on July 4, 1817. Eight years later, Clinton, returned to office, directed the great celebration of the Erie Canal's completion. \"Clinton's Ditch\" was a popular and immediate financial success and contributed enormously to the growth and prosperity of New York and the Northwest Territory as well.

Particularly intriguing to audiences was Edison's phonograph, the recent improvement of which Anderson chose to picture. Although Edison patented the device in 1877, earning himself the title of the \"Wizard of Menlo Park,\" eleven years passed before he achieved sufficient clarity of sound to make it commercially viable. Using the word \"specie\" as a test, Edison labored until it could be properly transmitted. \"When that was done,\" Edison reported, \"I knew everything else could be done, which was a fact.\"",

By the time he reached thirty, his theory of relativity and work in quantum mechanics had revolutionized physics and profoundly altered our perception of the world. Einstein naturally commanded great prestige in the United States when he sought refuge from the Nazi regime of his native Germany in 1933. His words thus carried enormous weight in 1939 when he wrote a letter alerting President Roosevelt that Germany was moving toward the development of nuclear weaponry. Eventually, that warning gave impetus to the Manhattan Project, the top-secret venture that in 1945 produced the world's first atomic bomb. While sitting for this likeness in 1944, Einstein mused to his portraitist, \"After fifty years they will say of me, either he was a great man or a fool!\"",

Ericsson, posing with a model of his \"tin can on a raft,\" always worked alone and had previously perfected engines for many purposes, including fire engines and a steam locomotive.

        "Description": "Benjamin Franklin, in his day the most famous American in the world, returned from his years representing colonial interests in England just in time to be unanimously elected to represent Pennsylvania at the Second Continental Congress. Behind him was a lifetime of achievement as a printer, an unsurpassed author of wit and wisdom, an inventor, and a scientist. Ahead were his roles as a signer of the Declaration of Independence and as a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1787. In between was his triumph as a diplomat in France, where this portrait was ordered by Madame Brillon de Jouy, who loved Franklin's \"droll roguishness which shows that the wisest of men allows his wisdom to be perpetually broken against the rocks of femininity.\" In 1995 this portrait was selected as the basis for Franklin's engraving on the redesigned $100 bill.

        "Description": "Born Milton, Massachusetts  Although not an accredited architect, Buckminster Fuller was best known for his many experiments in building design and his philosophy of architecture. Adhering to his \"dymaxion\" principle, which called for maximum results from a minimum of material and energy, he was an early advocate of prefabrication and modular construction. The most famous of Fuller's achievements was the geodesic dome, which artist Boris Artzybasheff wittily depicts here as the structure of Fuller's face and skull. Patented in 1947, this spherical structure required no internal support, thus creating an unobstructed interior space. In 1967, one of Fuller's domes served as the United States pavilion at the world exposition in Montreal, where it became a symbol of America's tradition in technical innovation.  ",

        "Description": "Herbert Hoover seemed to be the ultimate problem-solver. As a mining engineer, he had turned marginal operations into thriving enterprises. During World War I, his administration of European food relief was nothing short of brilliant. As secretary of commerce in the 1920s, he transformed a once-sleepy department into a purposeful information clearinghouse. But as the Great Depression took hold during the second year of his presidency, Hoover was hard pressed for a solution. Believing in the power of private initiative, he hesitated to involve the federal government in reviving business. When lengthening bread lines and escalating joblessness finally convinced him of the necessity of such steps, the measures proved inadequate. As a result, Hoover was defeated by a crushing margin in his 1932 reelection bid. This portrait was intended for Time magazine's cover. But Hoover delayed his sittings, and by the time it was finished, the magazine was no longer interested. Hoover is thus the only president in Time's history never to appear on a cover while in office. ",

Jefferson appears younger than his fifty years, perhaps evoking the young man the artist remembered as the Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress. Jefferson was well known to Americans in 1791, having also served as governor of Virginia and ambassador to France. Notwithstanding George Washington's desire for unity in his administration, Jefferson quickly found himself at odds with Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, whose power and influence on the president rivaled his own. Jefferson favored a smaller, weaker national government, with more power residing in the states, and closer ties to France; Hamilton argued for a powerful national government allied to Great Britain. From these differences the first American party system-Democratic-Republicans (Jefferson) versus Federalists (Hamilton)-was born.",

        "Description": "As the new American republic emerged from its war with the mother country, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, collaborators in the formulation of the Declaration of Independence (although Jefferson wrote the final document), were brought together as trade negotiators in France, where their mutual respect turned into friendship. In the spring of 1786-when Jefferson was the American minister to France and Adams the American minister to England-Jefferson visited Adams, who suggested that he pose for the young Boston-born artist Mather Brown. An exchange of portraits between the two colleagues ensued. This painting, the earliest known likeness of Jefferson, remained in Adams's family until given to the nation in 1999. \tThe background contains the classical figure of Freedom holding a staff topped by a cap, which had its origins in the conical cloth cap adopted by freed Roman slaves as the symbol of their liberty.

He omitted, however, any mention of being the third president of the United States, perhaps because his policies failed to end encroachments on American rights during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 1800s. Great Britain, with its naval superiority, forbade American ships from supplying Napoleon\u95c1\u70bd\u5132\u941b?armies and forced American sailors to serve in its navy (impressment). After failing to change British policy with a Non-Importation Act (1806), Congress passed Jefferson\u95c1\u70bd\u5132\u941b?Embargo Act (1807), prohibiting American ships and goods from leaving port. In the final month of his presidency, Jefferson repealed the embargo and signed the Non-Intercourse Act, which reopened trade with all nations except Great Britain and France. It also authorized his successor, James Madison, to resume trade with whichever of those nations stopped violating American neutral trading rights. ",

His influential American buildings include the Philadelphia Water Works, New York City Hall, and redesigns of the Capitol and White House after they were burned in the War of 1812. Latrobe and artist Charles Frederick von Breda were at the beginning of their careers in London when this portrait was made. Von Breda created it to recall the lively and successful composition of a larger painting now in the collection of the Maryland Historical Society.",

Cyrus McCormick, a farmer in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, succeeded where his father had failed by constructing the first practical reaping machine. This reaper was a first step in the mechanization of American agriculture, allowing the efficient cultivation of large tracts of farmland by small numbers of farmers. This industrialization of the land allowed the United States to boost agricultural production to unprecedented levels and to feed growing cities and industrial towns. McCormick's design was pirated by competitors, but he overcame his rivals by founding his own factory outside Chicago in 1847. There, he contributed to the pace of industrial growth by using standardized parts and assembly-line production-methods that had been pioneered by Samuel Colt and others. ",

But around 1832 he became fascinated with the idea of sending messages via electric wire. With no scientific or mechanical training, Morse devised an elegant machine that sent coded messages by opening and closing an electrical circuit. While the government neglected the telegraph, private businesses seized on the new invention as a great leap forward in communications technology. At a time when railways and water transportation were binding the country together, Morse did the same with a network of instantaneous communication. Speed has always characterized America, and Morse's breakthrough was the gigantic first step in creating ever-faster means of communicating. ",

        "Description": "Born Queen Anne's County, Maryland  A creative and energetic force throughout the Revolutionary era and the early Republic, Charles Willson Peale moved to London in 1767 to study painting with Benjamin West. In 1769 he returned to Maryland, where he made portraits of landowners and their families before settling in Philadelphia in 1776. Peale, a militiaman and political figure, sided with radical factions during and after the Revolution, and painted portraits of national heroes in the fight for independence. His portrait gallery became a feature of his Philadelphia Museum-the nation's first significant museum of natural history-which opened to the public in 1786. His energy and abilities made him a sought-after painter of portraits of George Washington, a correspondent of Thomas Jefferson, and the leader of an expedition to exhume the skeleton of a mastodon. Members of his large family followed in his footsteps as artists, scientists, and museum entrepreneurs.",

Although he was celebrated for leading the first American exploring expedition through the Grand Canyon in 1869, his greater contribution came from his scientific reports on western lands and the peoples living there, many of which contradicted long-held beliefs. His advocacy of communal or government control of water for irrigation in the West was derided at the time, yet his studies served as the foundation for twentieth-century water-use policies. As director of both the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology, Powell saw science as a vital force in promoting the common good. ",

        "Description": "Revolutionary War colonel John Stevens, trained in the law and self-educated as an engineer, was a pioneer in steam-engine experimentation. In 1804 his small steamboat, Little Juliana, operated by twin-screw propellers, made a successful trip across the Hudson and back to the New Jersey shore. Barred by the monopoly held by Robert Fulton from operating on the Hudson River, Stevens in 1808 sent his paddle steamer Phoenix-the first completely American-built steam engine-to Philadelphia by sea and opened a steamship line between that city and Trenton. In 1825 Stevens designed the first American-built steam locomotive, operating it, at the rate of over twelve miles per hour, on a circular track on his estate in Hoboken to demonstrate the feasibility of steam (as a replacement for horses) to power railroad transportation.

In these compositions, the subject's face is seen through an oval stonework frame-an honorific convention in European art dating from the Renaissance.",

        "Description": "When Americans chose their first president under the new Constitution of 1788, George Washington's election was a foregone conclusion. But despite Washington's prestige, his presidency had its critics. Toward the end of his administration, one newspaper branded him a \"scourge and misfortune.\" This portrait shows some of the stress that even our first president felt under the burden of the office. Even under attack, however, Washington's firm leadership gave credibility to the new federal government and assured its survivability. Young Rembrandt Peale, then seventeen, was so nervous about painting Washington that his artist father, Charles Willson Peale, had to come along to the sittings to soothe his son's jangled nerves. The younger Peale made several replicas of his resulting portrait, including this version.",

        "Description": "George Washington, appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental army, took command of a ragtag force of some 17,000 men in July 1775. He kept an army together for the next eight-and-a-half years-losing more battles than he won-but effectively ended the war with his victory at Yorktown in October 1781. Mission accomplished, Washington-a hero who could have been king-resigned his military commission before Congress on December 23, 1783, and retired to Mount Vernon. Here, the man all artists yearned to portray posed in his Continental army uniform for English artist Robert Edge Pine and wryly observed, \"I am so hackneyed to the touches of the Painter's pencil, that I am now altogether at their beck, and sit like patience on a Monument.\"",

        "Description": "As the general who led us to victory in the American Revolution and as our first president, George Washington was often painted and sculpted. Everyone, it seemed, wanted the hero's portrait. But it is this portrait that stands for all time as the image that best represents what Washington meant to us when we were a new nation and continues to mean to us in the twenty-first century. It is the one picture that we can say ranks in importance with those sacred founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. \tWe see Washington in 1796, the last year of his two-term presidency. Earlier full-length portraits show him in military uniform, but here he is in civilian dress, revealing that in our democracy the elected executive is the true commander-in-chief. Standing in elegant surroundings suggesting the grandeur of European tradition, Washington is nonetheless not draped like a king, which he refused to be; he is a man powerful only by the people's consent. This was the man who told us what this new kind of leader-an elected president-could be and whose maturity and resolve gave us confidence in our future. The rainbow behind him breaks through a stormy sky. \tWashington was lucky in his portraitist, and so are we. American-born Gilbert Stuart had eighteen years in Europe to hone his artistry. He was commissioned by Senator and Mrs. William Bingham of Pennsylvania to provide a gift to the Marquis of Lansdowne, an English supporter of American independence. It was copied by Stuart and others as THE image of Washington who sustains our national purpose-the Washington every generation of Americans needs to rediscover.Gilbert Stuart (1755-1828)",

        "Description": "American artist Gilbert Stuart was commissioned to paint this portrait after the success of his first portrait of Washington in 1795. Martha Washington convinced the president to sit again because, according to artist Rembrandt Peale, she \"wished a Portrait for herself; he therefore consented on the express condition that when finished it should be hers.\" Stuart, however, preferred this portrait to his earlier Washington; he purposely left it and that of the first lady unfinished so that he could use this as a model for the numerous copies that the first president's admirers commissioned. After Stuart's death, the two paintings were purchased for the Boston Athenaeum, which owned them for more than 150 years.  This image served as the basis for the engraving of Washington on the one-dollar bill. John Neal, an early-nineteenth-century writer and art critic, wrote: \"Though a better likeness of him were shown to us, we should reject it; for, the only idea that we now have of George Washington, is associated with Stuart's Washington.\"",

        "Description": "Born Birmingham, Alabama  Biologist Edward O. Wilson-two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction-has been a leader of the biodiversity movement since the 1980s. Trained as an entomologist specializing in ant biology, Wilson has ranged from New Guinea and Sri Lanka to the Smithsonian Institution for his work. His groundbreaking Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975) was a controversial study that examined the biological basis of social behavior in all kinds of organisms, including vertebrates, with links to evolutionary biology. A hallmark of his later work has been an attempt to bridge the gap between science and the culture at large, as in Consilience: The Unity of Life (1998).  \tArtist Jennie Summerall posed Wilson in a setting reminiscent of the landscape on Lignum Vitae Key in Florida, which he helped preserve. Based on photographic images, the painting references Wilson's earlier studies on ant populations, while depicting him as he looks today.",

        "Description": "Career army officer Zachary Taylor vaulted to national prominence as the hero of the Mexican War. Stationed in the Southwest, Taylor had anticipated war, and when conflict broke out with Mexico he was able to quickly cross the Rio Grande in a campaign that culminated in the defeat of General Santa Anna at Buena Vista in 1847. This painting shows Taylor with his staff at Walnut Creek, Texas, just as hostilities broke out. The Polk administration distrusted Taylor, an outspoken Whig, fearing he would use his military career for political ends. But they could not deny the appeal of a victorious general, and Taylor was elected president in 1849 as a symbol of national unity. Sectional differences over slavery were proving intractable, however, and Taylor had a short, unhappy term as president, dying amid negotiations over the Compromise of 1850. ",
