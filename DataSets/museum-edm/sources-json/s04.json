A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important political figures. ?One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the \u95b3\u30e6\u7a7ethenaeum Head ?currently on the dollar bill.\r\nIn this painting, the woman and children are posed against a drawn drape in the style of British portraiture. ?The similarity of the colors used in the sash, chair, curtain and trim on the young boy\u95b3\u30e6 ?jacket move the viewer\u95b3\u30e6 ?eye around the canvas to encompass all the figures. The woman is wearing a simple, elegant, robe  ?l\u95b3\u30e6\u734cnglaise, a gown favored by portrait painters of the period. ?The woman\u95b3\u30e6 ?hair is lightly powdered and fashionably styled in the coiffure  ?l'h\u947c\u5379isson, or \u95b3\u30e6\u7b01edgehog, ?in which the hair was cut short in the front, frizzed to the ends and then brushed up away from the face. ?Reference\r\nCarrie Rebora Barratt, Ellen Gross Miles. ?Gilbert Stuart, New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2004. ?ISBN-13: 978-1588391247",
