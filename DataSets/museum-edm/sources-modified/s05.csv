His intention to create panoramic views of the American frontier was apparent by December 1858, just before he embarked on the trip. In early 1859 he accompanied a government survey expedition, headed by Frederick W. Lander, to the Nebraska Territory. By summer, the party had reached the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains in what is now Wyoming. Bierstadt dubbed the central mountain in the picture Lander's Peak following the colonel's death in the Civil War. This was one of a number of large works painted after Bierstadt's return from these travels. It was completed in 1863, exhibited to great acclaim, and purchased in 1865 for the then-astounding sum of $25,000 by James McHenry, an American living in London.

This apparently was one of the pictures that he brought with him, and he sent it later that year for sale to the American Art-Union. It was first called ""French-Trader—Half breed Son,"" but the Art-Union gave it the title by which it is now known. Bingham, whose earliest efforts were portraits, produced a masterpiece of genre painting with little precedent in his oeuvre. The strikingly spare, geometric composition and luminist light recall the paintings of William Sidney Mount, particularly his ""Eel Spearing at Setauket"" (New York State Historical Association, Cooperstown). The solemn, motionless scene immortalizes the vanished world of the American frontier, constructed for a northeastern audience. The tranquil work was submitted to the Art-Union as a possible companion to the more implicitly violent ""The Concealed Enemy"" (Stark Museum of Art, Orange, Texas), in which an armed Osage warrior lies in wait behind a boulder. The polar opposition of quietude, savagery, and frontier danger embodied in the paintings held enormous appeal for urban viewers.

In the midst of painting ""The Course of Empire"" (New-York Historical Society), Cole mentioned in a letter dated March 2, 1836, to his patron Luman Reed that he was executing a large version of this subject expressly for exhibition and sale. The picture was shown at the National Academy of Design in 1836 as ""View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm."" Cole's interest in the subject probably dates from his 1829-32 trip to Europe, during which he made an exact tracing of the view published in Basil Hall's ""Forty Etchings Made with the Camera Lucida in North America in 1827 and 1828."" Hall criticized Americans' inattentiveness to their scenery, and Cole responded with a landscape that lauds the uniqueness of America by encompassing ""a union of the picturesque, the sublime, and the magnificent."" Although often ambiguous about the subjugation of the land, here the artist juxtaposes untamed wilderness and pastoral settlement to emphasize the possibilities of the national landscape, pointing to the future prospect of the American nation. Cole's unequivocal construction and composition of the scene, charged with moral significance, is reinforced by his depiction of himself in the middle distance, perched on a promontory painting the Oxbow. He is an American producing American art, in communion with American scenery. There are both sketchbook drawings with annotations and related oil sketches of this subject. Many other artists copied or imitated the painting.","Charles N. Talbot, New York, by June 1838-died 1874; his estate; Mrs. Russell Sage, New York, until 1908",84ba3437b452

The painting shows the girl at about the age of seventeen, sitting with a sketchbook in her lap and pencil in hand with her eyes raised in contemplation. Although traditionally described as a Muse, the figure is more likely a personification of the art of drawing or design. Morse drew on the full extent of his European training, taking from the works of Rubens and Veronese in what was to be an ambitious farewell to his career as an artist. Stymied by a lack of financial success, he abandoned painting for science and inventing. This painting was first exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1837, where it won enthusiastic praise. Susan married Edward Lind in 1839 and moved to his sugar plantation in Puerto Rico, returning often to New York to spend extended periods with her father, who had been left a widower when Susan was just six.

The original portrait, the full-length version now in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, was a tremendous success and Peale completed numerous copies for royal palaces abroad, each time updating the general's military dress. This figure of George Washington was probably painted between June and August of 1780. In every other version, Washington is shown after the Battle of Princeton, but here he is depicted after the Battle of Trenton, the turning point of the war.

Based on comparisons to self-portraits, Pratt is the man at the easel, an accomplished portrait painter. The identities of the other artists represented in the picture remain uncertain, but they are younger and they draw rather than paint. The composition explores the academic tradition as carried out among Americans in late-eighteenth century London.","the artist's son, Nathan Pratt, Philadelphia (until 1805); the artist's great-granddaughter, Rosalie V.

The famed equestrian statue, dedicated to the Civil War hero William Tecumseh Sherman (1820-1891), is one of Manhattan's finest public sculptures, and a noble heir to the equestrian tradition begun in ancient Rome and continued through the Renaissance. Saint-Gaudens' ""Victory"" has traditional attributes—a laurel crown and a palm leaf—and is depicted by Saint-Gaudens as a guiding force. Her outstretched right arm leads the obediant horse, upon which sits a battle-hardened General Sherman. Saint-Gaudens painstakingly arranged drapery on numerous nude models for ""Victory"" before settling on what he believed was the perfect flow of her robe. Letters written by Saint-Gaudens near the completion of the monument reveal his triumphant feelings about the monument, and the figure of ""Victory."" In a letter to his niece, Rose S. Nichols, he wrote, ""It's the greatest 'Victory' anybody ever made. Hooraah!""",,ad5e1ae19401

Sargent hoped to enhance his reputation by painting and exhibiting her portrait. Working without a commission but with his sitter’s complicity, he emphasized her daring personal style, showing the right strap of her gown slipping from her shoulder. At the Salon of 1884, the portrait received more ridicule than praise. Sargent repainted the shoulder strap and kept the work for over thirty years. When, eventually, he sold it to the Metropolitan, he commented, “I suppose it is the best thing I have done,?but asked that the Museum disguise the sitter’s name.","The artist, 1884-1916",52906338b4ad

The sculptor exhibited a model to acclaim in the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in spring 1863. Contemporary appreciation for the statuette arose from a desire for art that addressed current issues rather than less tangible themes unrelated to American life. Not only does ""The Freedman"" comment on the chief political, social, and moral topic of the era, but it also proclaims Ward's abolitionist sentiments. The seminude man sits on a tree stump, the manacle on his left wrist and the chain in his right hand potent reminders of his former servitude. Enhancing the statuette's powerful theme is Ward's commitment to realism. The fidelity to physiognomy and anatomical accuracy of the twisting body reveal an unprecedented naturalism in nineteenth-century American sculpture.","Charles Rollinson Lamb, died 1942; the Lamb family, until 1979",29bf1f0abe3b
