"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>January 14th/Sunday eve--/<br>Dear Miss Breed,/Thank you ever so much for your lovely card and hankie. I don't know how to apologize for not sending you a Christmas card or greetings. I left most of my Christmas shopping to the last minute and then three days before Christmas that nasty cold caught up with me and put me into bed. That is my sad sad story. However, there was a bright side to Christmas--my brother came from Milwaukee to visit us./We're all very proud of him, and we're certainly glad to see him. He has now graduated from Marquette, and at the present time is trying his hardest to get into Med School there. He was indeed lucky to be asked to join an honorary Biology fraternity--I've forgotten the name. It seems that Nisei's are not accepted at Marquette Med School, but my brother feels that he may be able to break the ice. At least he is trying--we will know in about three or four weeks definitly whether or not he will be accepted./I should like to tell you some very pleasant news--my sister and Bill are going to have a blessed event some time in May or June. We're all very happy in anticipation--but I think Bill is most excited. My mother is planning to come out in May, which we are eagerly anticipating. Incidentally, my father wrote that at the Canteen raffle in Crystal City my mother won a suitcase and is planning to come up with it. It makes a very good prize, doesn't it? The way my wrote it was so cute it makes me laugh just thinking about it./Last Friday night my girlfriend gave me one of these so called home permanents. All her previous ones were successful--but mine was an utter flop! When we rinsed it--it was absolutely straight! It makes me laugh just to think about it! I'll have to make an appointment at some beauty shop and get a genuine one. This will cost me more money in the long run!/The news of being able to go back to California has been accepted with mingled feeling. First of all we're more than glad that the ban has been lifted, as it rightfully should be. Those with property are wanting to go back, but wondering how the sentiment will be. Of course we know that good friends like you would be glad to have us back but others who do not know us or understand us may not be as glad to see us. As for us who are not so fortunate to have property in California--we're content to stay here for a while or maybe the rest of our life, but we'll make a point of seeing and visiting California later. My first ambition upon getting back to San Diego is to see you./ Well, this will be all for now. But may I wish you a happy New Year and hope you'll write when you have time./Sincerely/Fusa","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Minneapolis, Minnesota, January 14, 1945","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Aiko Kubo to Clara Breed + 1 photographic print : b&amp;w; ; 4 x 2.25 in.  Transcription:<br>June 20, 1944 / Dear Miss Breed, / I just received your lovely note a few minutes ago and would like to take this opportunity to thank you for what you have done, not only for me, but for all of us in Poston. Words cannot express how we feel about you and several others whom the war has not affected in your attitude toward us. / Recently, I applied for college entrance to Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota through the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council. However, I don't know whether I can get in or not, since the quota may have already been reached. I certainly hope not! / Both Shizuye and Yoshiko were married last year, so the house is quite empty now. However, Irene makes enough noise to make up for their absence. I imagine you'd be surprised to see her now--she's almost as tall as I am, and lankier. My brother, George, is hardly ever home, as he spends his time roaming around the camp with his own ""gang."" / We received our annuals a few days ago. I'm sorry to say that I couldn't continue my work on the Annual as Art Editor, since I finished high school in February. However, I know that I left that job in capable hands--I believe you remember June Watanabe? She did a wonderful job!! As soon as I have most of the signatures of the seniors, I will send the annual to you so that you may see what school life in Poston is like. We, of Parker Valley Hi, are proud of the fact that our school is accredited by the state--and we owe all that to our able principal, Miss Cushman, who is outside just now. / I'm enclosing a snapshot of myself which was taken by a visiting serviceman--(cameras not being allowed on the project for civilian use.) Incidentally, all the boys in camp are being inducted into the army every week. Some who volunteered are already overseas and taking active part in the invasion. I'm sure they have quite a lot to fight for!! / I shall end this letter with a ""thank you"" from the very bottom of my heart. / Sincerely, / Aiko Kubo / <br>[inscribed on photograph] / Miss Breed- / Always / Aiko","Letter to Clara Breed from Aiko Kubo, Poston, Arizona, June 20, 1944","Kubo, Aiko",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Hisako Watanabe to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>August 11, 1944/Dear Miss Breed,/I hope you will forgive me for not writing to you long before this./I hope you are in the very best of health. It certainly is hard to get hired help now so I can imagine how busy you must be./Well, much has happened since I last heard from you. I have been working as secretary to the chief nurse here at the hospital since January 1944. It is very interesting work and I am always meeting new people./ Three weeks ago Miss Vickers, my employer gave me a two weeks' vacation and my brother and I went to Manzanar, California (which is just another relocation center. The weather in Manzanar is cooler in comparison with Poston. The first night back we almost roasted because of the intense heat. The water in Manzanar is like the kind we used to buy in San Diego and it is always ice cold no matter what time of day one turns the faucet on. While we were there we could still see snow on the mountain peaks./The canteens there are always crowded. They have much more in the way of food, reading material, refreshments, etc. One thing we were able to get there which we can't get in Poston was cocoa cola and 7 up./We certainly missed eating watermelon though. During our three weeks' stay we only received two tiny pieces of watermelon while on the other hand, here in Poston we are able to get all one can eat./ Manzanar is prettier than Poston because there is more green grass and lots of trees. On the whole, we thought it was very nice and something different. But even then, we think our own camp is much better./Dick, my brother, is much better. He hasn't been using crutches for quite some time. He is well except for a slight limp in his left leg. He goes all over the camp now. It sure is good to see him up and around again./Jack has certainly grown and I imagine if you were to see him you wouldn't recognize him. He is in the fifth grade now. He still does quite a bit of reading./While we were in San Diego I remember how my mother used to scold him because he read too much. We would have to take his book away or turn out the lights before he would stop./I have been planning to relocate but am unable to do so at the present time due to financial difficulties. I am still kind of doubtful as to where to go. I have decided on either one of these three places, Chicago, Cleveland, or New York. I will write and let you know more definitely after I make my plans. Maybe the next time I write to you, I may be on the outside./ I'm glad you liked the various ornaments mother made. I can't thank you enough for all you have done for us in the way of presents, etc. Words cannot express the feeling we had upon receiving your gifts./ I hope you will have a few spare minutes in which you can write to me. I will be only too happy to hear from you. Please write real soon as I'll be waiting./Sincerely,/Hisako Watanabe/P.S./ In looking over your last letter you mention something about a dictionary. I don't recall exactly what I asked for but I believe it was a shorthand dictionary I wanted. In any case, I would appreciate it very much if you could find one for me./Thank you again for everything and please take care of yourself.","Letter to Clara Breed from Hisako Watanabe, Poston, Arizona, August 11, 1944","Watanabe, Hisako",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Yes, I found out through the kindness of Miss Batchelder that you were unable to come to Chicago. I was quite disappointed but knowing how difficult it is to travel I quickly tried to forget my disappointment. I hope we will be able to meet again soon./Thank you most sincerely for going through all the trouble of writing a recommendation for me. You have been so wonderful to me, Miss Breed. No words in the dictionary can express how I feel./Yes, I have heard people returning to California. I am so happy that we are being accepted again in our cities where we spend much of our happy moments. I too would like to go to San Diego and yet hesitate. With public sentiment as it is, I think it might be best to start life anew in a new community. Making wonderful friends like you, I know will take time for we must first prove to them ourselves. Life would be so wonderful if all this hatred and racial discrimination was abolished from the earth. But I believe the war has taught all of us a great deal. I know it has for me. I have come to appreciate so many things that I have taken for granted before the war. My new life here in this vast Chicago, making my own living, depending on myself is something I never dreamed would happen. But it has and in a way I am glad for through my experiences I shall gain much and become that much wiser through my hardships./This Thanksgiving I enjoyed snow for the first time in my life. It was really a sight to see the housetops covered with white white snow. It was just like a picture you see on Xmas cards. But staying in a nice heated apartment takes you away from the icy wind and snow. We have a very nice furnished apt. We all have loads of fun cooking and keeping house. We all do the cooking--taking turns. As yet no one has fallen ill through each others experiments which we are proud of./Thank you for the advice about isolating myself. I would like to go out and meet people too. Yes, McClurgs is a very large firm with many nisei's as their employees. I have not heard of any clubs organized by the co./It certainly was a surprise to hear Hisako's brothers are relocating. Her oldest brother has recovered though he has a limp.

Daugherty/2880 Fairfax Road/Cleveland Heights, Ohio/Oh my, how I would love to have those beautiful flowers! I often stop at a florists and gaze at the beautiful flowers in the window!

"1 letter and envelope from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>322-14-D/Poston, Arizona/June 10, 1944/Dear Miss Breed,/Six years ago today I graduated from San Diego High School--Tonight the first graduating class of Parker Valley High School marched into the partially constructed school auditorium and received their diplomas. They looked splendid in their caps and gowns. The boys were in blue and the girls, in white. Incidently that is the school color combination./Through the wonderful efforts of Poston III's school principal, Miss Cushman, and the faculty, Poston III High School this spring became an accredited high school and the name was changed to Parker Valley High School. Poston I and II High Schools are as yet unaccredited. If I am not mistaken I believe Parker Valley High School is the only relocation center high school that has been so honored./It is magnificent the way the students have striven for higher education. The first year here found them in make-shift barrack classrooms. When construction of the school began the whole community volunteered in making adobe bricks for the school buildings. Even school children helped so that school could open in time for the fall semester of 1943-1944. Yes, the students can rightfully be proud to say ""It's my school"" for they built it with sweat and toil during the hot summer days that Poston is noted for./--Just a few rambling comments on the graduation ceremony. The class gift was a beautiful American flag. Instead of a vocal selection there was a piano solo by Elain Hibi a very talented pianist from San Diego. I believe this is the first American high school graduation ceremony to have a Buddhist blessing. The class moot: The past, forever gone; the future still our own. There were nine honor students. I didn't get all their names but I did catch one and the name is Aiko Kubo (remember her?)/-------------------/I had hoped to be a barber at Camp Savage, Minn. The offer came to me during the last of February. In a routine checking of the arm, the doctor advised me that the arm bone is in a rather dubious state and that it would take some time before the condition would clear up. I could have walked under a snake's belly, I felt so low. Plans for leaving the first part of March were knocked into a cocked hat. That blow hit me pretty hard. I just existed from day to day. Even now I can't remember just what I did. The days seemed all the same. In May I had another consultation and the doctor advised me that it would be several more months before they could be definite on the arm. Yes ma'am I really began to feel sorry for myself but bad. Then I read some articles in the Pacific Citizen, the JACL newspaper. It told of the heroic deeds of the nisei soldiers, of the hardships they suffered.---I woke up. What I am going thru is nothing compared to the fighting man on the front./I am back in training now. I am taking weight-lifting to condition my body. Exercise seems to do my arm more good than resting it all the time. I have started playing golf. The arm is a handicap but after all there are one armed golfers who do all right, besides I have fun. I am trying to learn how to play bridge, too. Just now with all the exercising and music lessons (I am still trying to play a guitar) I am kept pretty busy after work. It certainly helps to keep my mind off the fact that I can't relocate just yet. Time seems to fly right by. I received quite a jolt when I realized that it won't be long before 1944 is half over. /The days are getting very hot now. The winds blow much more this year than last. They help to keep the days bearable./How did San Diego take the news of the invasion? I didn't know about it for two days--at that I thought it was a rumor around camp. You see I hadn't seen a newspaper in weeks and our radio doesn't work until the early hours of the morning at which time I am usually asleep. Most of the people here in camp were like me--we just didn't know abou","Letter to Clara Breed from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki, Poston, Arizona, June 10, 1944","Hirasaki, Tetsuzo",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

And after I haven't written for so long, too. I don't have any excuse, either. / I'll be seeing you soon, because we're going back to San Diego soon. We want to see Michigan first, if we can. Relocation offers such chances for travel!! / The camp is going to close in 1946, but after this year, we aren't going to have any more school. And just after they finished the new high school building, too. / I certainly do enjoy junior high school. It's too a period, though. We only have 50 minutes for our subjects. But we have three hours of core. / I have a kitten now, and it's the sweetest thing! I found him in music class, where we had an awful time trying to hide her from our teacher. / Lately we've been having rainy weather. We had rain on Christmas--for the second time! We always seem to have rain, or some other incident on holidays. One Christmas we had one of the biggest fires in Poston, and on one Thanksgiving we had another fire. One Fourth of July, a little girl got lost on our block. Another one was lost recently--but not on a holiday! / Is Miss McNary still working in the library. By the way, our public and school libraries are getting a lot of new books--they look so good, too! / My mother used to work as a cashier at the canteen, but she has been promoted to head cashier, and is working in the community enterprise office. At first she didn't like it too much, but now she doesn't want to quit! / In sewing class so far, we've made tea towels, aprons, and now we're on skirts. A few have finished, and are on their petticoats. The we are going to do blouses, and if we can, we are going to make dresses. The other day we tried a little cooking, and made cookies. Mine had too much salt, and was too heavy. But I'll learn. / In science class we have the most fun. Our teacher, Mr. Dugan, was talking about gastric juices, and my girlfriend thought he said plastic juices! And whenever we think we know a word, it turns out to be far different! / All our classes are at the other end of camp, so we don't have enough time to get home for lunch. So now we bring our lunches, and we have a lot of fun. There are only six of us, but the noise we make would be enough for three times as much. We always ""swap"" if we have anything to swap! / I have so many pen pals now that I can't keep them all in order. Last night I counted my letters and I have 388! Before we go out of camp, I hope I have 400. / I've got quite a lot of books now, too. I have 75. Pretty soon I'll have 100--I hope. / I've got to ask my mother to mail this for me, and since she has to go soon, I better close. I'm sorry this is such a short letter. / Love, / Katherine / P.S. / Thank you ever so much for the flower seeds, too. I want to plant them, but my mother says I better not, since we're going out soon.","Letter to Clara Breed from Katherine Tasaki, Poston, Arizona, December 27, 1944","Tasaki, Katherine",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>June 2, 1944/Dear Miss Breed, /I'm sorry that I did not write to you sooner. It's long been on my conscience, but just everyday living keeps us busy. /As you know, I am living with my sis and her husband. All three of us are working; they in Heinrich Envelope Co., and I in L.S. Donaldson Company, a dept store, as a typist in the mail order division. The work is monotonous and rather tiring at times, but I enjoy it. There are lots of things to learn, people are nice, and my typing has increased in speed and my accuracy is getting better. We're slightly swamped with work and consequently have little time to fool around, like in camp, but time passes fast./Thank you for the letter you sent me, and it was especially nice since it arrived the same day that I did. By the time I received your second letter, I was already working, so did not see the ladies you so kindly wrote about. However, I am planning to go to school (business) and after graduation take a civil service exam if any of the ladies could help me, work with them. School will begin in the fall for me. There is summer school, but this seems a waste of time as it is not as concentrated, so have decided to wait until fall. /Last Sunday Ikuko Kuratomi (do you remember her?) called me. She is living in St. Paul and attending Hameline University. She is coming over this Sunday for dinner and we hope to get some reminiscing and patchwork of our life pattern put together. Their family did not go to Poston with the rest of the S.D. people; they went to Denson, Arkansas. After that I lost track of her, but was always under the impression that she was in Milwaukee. I was certainly surprised to know that she's in the twin city instead. /It is certainly sultry hot here. We have sudden thunder showers, but still it doesn't get very much cooler. There really isn't any place that has as ideal weather as good old S.D. You should appreciate the mild weather that's from one who knows!/I miss my folks more than I realized or thought I would. These waves come over me every once in a while, but am slowly getting used to living without them. Am really beginning to understand the value of money, too. /How are you? Have you had your vacation yet this year? What are you going to do or done already? /Please give Miss McNary my best regard. Your mother, too. Take good care of yourself. Write soon./As ever,/Fusa","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Minneapolis, Minnesota, June 2, 1944","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

And theres a chance that the book may be /Page 2/turned down. /I think the hardest part is the typewriter. I love to use it, but I really never learned. /I've got lots of time, because I can't go to school. (Walking too much hurts.) My story will be about a little Japanese girl like me.

The last two days have been windy, and it's a wonder the roof doesn't blow off. It almost did last year./I have quite a collection of hobbies, but they have grown bigger. My original hobbies were: jars + bottles, movie stars, books, and pins. I've added: stamps, postmarks, pen pals, paper dolls, and collecting hobbies!/I answered some letters in my magazine, and I'm surprised at the results.

It seems after my sister's marriage, I have neglected my correspondance for at this moment I am enjoying quite a headache trying to catch up on it. /I was indeed happy to hear from you and was extremely pleased to hear you like the little Xmas gift. I do not know who made it, but I do know it is made out of mesquite./Well, I hope today is the last of the heavy rainfall we have been having. I understand California is having its share too. Here is Poston it has been raining continuously for almost one week. I love the rain except for the muddy ground. The schools were closed for two days because of the muddy grounds. The children certainly were happy about that! I hope we will have nice sunny weather soon though I do dread the hot summer months that are ahead. /Yes, the swimming pool is now completed and is filled with water. I imagine that will be the most favorite spot for all when June, July, August rolls around. /The adobe school is completed too except for the auditorium. At present Miss Cushman is trying awfully hard to have each department with their complete equipments so the school can be accredited through the Arizona State Education Dept./I think the Education Dept. is the most busiest place in Poston. We always seem to find loads of work to do, but I know that is very excellent experience for us. I know my experiences here will be of great aid to me in the future. /My sister is now living in St. Paul, Minnesota. Yes, for me it will be difficult to step into the life outside since I am yet quite young, but I would like to take a stab at it. I hope someday soon I will be able to do so./ This year the seniors were very fortunate to have their pictures taken. Through the courtesy of the photographer, I was lucky enough to have mine taken too. At present I am waiting its arrive./The most common topic of conversation today seems to concern the reclassification draft situation. Most of the parents are very much concerned. Since the moral of the camp is low I sometimes wonder what the opinion of the boys are. /I do hope Miss Plaister is well on the road to recovery!! I can understand how it is when someone so essential is sick because we often sit at our desks wishing Miss Cushman was there when she isn't./I hope everything is fine with you, Miss Breed! Do take good care of yourself and please give my regards to Miss McNary./Most respectfully,/Louise Ogawa","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, February 27, 1944","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>323-11-D / Poston, Arizona / April 8, 1943 / Dear Miss Breed, / April 8, 1942. What memories run through my mind! Just one year ago today we entered Santa Anita Assembly Center into an undreamed of and unheard of world. Today, it seems as though it was a nice vacation period. Today I feel tired of this humdrum concentrated way of living. Most of us would like to go back into normal life and become useful American citizens. / Thanks very much for sending me the article ""All But Blind"" in the Library Journal. It was very interesting. It really warmed my heart because I know that good people like you who are willing to see our side of the story will help us in the future to become a part of America. This certainly would be the perfect America if all people could be as broad minded as you and not be swayed by public sentiment. / I also received the book ""A Star for Ginny"" by Phyllis A. Whitney. As yet I have not read it, but plan to do so immediately. I just finished reading ""Kings Row"" and was fascinated by the author's descriptions and his ability to tell of little things so well. / I have also received the crossword puzzles which you so faithfully send to me. I enjoy them immensely--but as yet have not filled in every word by myself. When that day comes, I guess I'll faint! / My brother seems to be doing fairly well in school. We received his mid-term grades and found him to have a good B average. We were very happy since it is his first semester there. Minoru Kojima plans to go out in June to Marquette, but it seems that the school is going to be turned over to the army. How that is going to affect the students is yet unknown.<br>April 9, 1943 / We have made plans to join my sister in Granada and hope to be out of here by May. / You mentioned in your last letter that you would like to visit Poston. We would be more than glad to have you come. It seems that you can get a pass after you come, but if you set a definite date I could get it for you. There are buses at the station on which you can get a ride here. Please come if you can.<br>April 10, 1943 / The weather here has been acting up this week. We've had rain off and on and lots of dust and wind blowing. Last week was so hot we thought that summer had already come. It is really queer weather we're having. / June Watanabe's father came from the hospital and is now living with his family. He is paralysed (spelling?) and unable to speak coherently, but he is able to understand very well. They certainly are glad to have him back. / It looks as though the army volunteers will be leaving soon. We feel sorry for them because there were so many parties thrown for them and as yet they haven't orders that they will leave. Most of the fellows seem to be impatient, and if they're going they want to go as soon as possible. / I've got to go to work now, so I will close. Please let me hear from you soon. / Love, / Fusa<br>","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Poston, Arizona, May 21, 1942","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"3 letters and envelope sent together from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>October 8, 1943 / Dear Miss Breed, / Tick tock tick tock goes the clock on my dresser. Yes, the old man time must have ticked a million times since I last wrote to you. I hope this letter finds you fine and dandy and as bright as a sunflower. I certainly missed hearing from you! We are all just fine though the mornings and nights are getting cold. / Nothing much has occurred except for the intestinal flu which is going around camp now. I was very fortunate (?) to have it visit me. If I ate just a little, my stomach notified me of its arrival. I just couldn't eat anything for it would hurt my tummy. I was very sad for I just love to eat! And it so happened we had pie-turnovers; nice juicy grapes--delicious foods all through the day. What a day to be sick!!! It was torture to see all that food just sitting on the tray before me. Well, I am just fine now and am just dying to see those turn-overs again. / We are kept quite busy these days at the office since school will commence Monday, October 11th. The new adobe schools are practically completed. The wooden frame work is painted a pretty blue. I imagine all the children will have a very nice school year with new teachers, books, tables, chairs and above all a new real school. I certainly do envy them! / My girl friends and I often talk of our future. Now I wish I took another major instead of commercial. It may be my depressed mood but I feel after I am outside, I won't be able to make use of my shorthand. I think something like cosmetology or teaching would have been more useful. I always did want to teach English to little children in Japan. But to do that, I will have to have a college education and I did not take a college prep. course. Whenever we discuss these things, we always end up where we started from. / Hisako tells me you are going around telling stories to little children. I imagine you have loads of fun with them. I'd love to listen to you too. / After I tell you the following news, you'll think I joined the band of the moving Poston indians. I am going to move again. We are moving back to block 330 this Tuesday. I'll probably be lost among our belongings for several weeks, like I always am. If I come out of it in one piece, I'll write and inform you of all the trouble we had in the process of moving. But I'll always be glad to hear from you whether I am sandwiched by the suitcases, or in the closet or under the cots. / I am anxious to see tonights movie, This Above All. My girl friends in other relocation centers write and say how much they enjoyed it and now we are going to have the privilege of seeing it. / Having stolen an hour of my working time, I'll get down to business like a good little girl. / Most respectfully, / Louise Ogawa / I just saw the biggest and longest whirl wind. One of the teachers commented that it's like seeing the Old Faithful at her most powerful stage. It was unbelievably large. / October 10, 1943 / Dear Miss Breed, / After reading your letter, I thought I'd wait until the sweater came. This waiting is killing me. Saturday we had another down-pour so the mail was not delivered. I can hardly wait until tomorrow. Thank you ever so much for all the trouble I caused you! / Thank you for the advice on sewing a ribbon across the back of the neck. I shall do that the very first thing. / Your friend certainly did have a strange experience. I can just imagine how crowded the trains and hotels are by your letter. I'll be sure to have someone go out with me when I go! / Yes, I still am employed at the school office. I am now classified as a stenographer. I take dictation, type letters, Transcriptions to be sent out to various schools where students have entered, take care of the dittoing and mimeography (cutting stencils etc.), file, answer the telephone, and taking care of teachers' reports, memos, etc. This work gives me experience in many different line","Letters to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, October 8, 1943","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Hisako Watanabe to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>January 7, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/I was overjoyed to hear from you and that lovely book!! you sent me. Thank you very much. When I saw the books it left me speechless with gladness and I cannot find words to express my feeling. You helped to enlighten my holiday spirits. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you have done for us. I appreciate the well you feel toward us Japanese. It is in times like these that we need all the friends we can make and it is our duty to keep these friends. I hope I didn't put you to a lot of trouble but in a place like this we haven't anything and I didn't know of any other way to ask you. I am sorry if I caused you a lot of extra work or trouble./I was glad to hear that you received the flowers in good shape. Everyone had some part of the package. William made the name pin for you. It looks like two different pieces of wood, my mother thought it was, but it is just one piece of mesquite wood with (over) two shades of color. Richard (my oldest brother) made the little geta. I hoped you would like everything and I hope it helped your Christmas to be a merrier one./I will be very glad to write to you and I hope you will find time to correspond with me too. There are many things I would like to tell you about Poston but if I were to try and tell you everything it would take too long. I will tell you a few things about our camp which is Camp 3./ The camp is made up of blocks. Each block has its own washroom, ironing room and latrine. There are 14 barracks and a mess hall or dining hall and a recreational hall in each block. It looks something like this [drawing of barracks and facilities, one block] I can't draw very good but I hope you can tell what a block looks like by this picture./Each family has dressed their barrack in a different way. We have a little vegetable garden on the side of the barrack. /The schools are better than what they were. When school started about 3 months ago there were no chairs, tables, books, etc. It was just a barren room. Everyone had their father or brother make them a chair. We had to carry these crude chairs from one class to another./ Now we have tables, chairs, and we just received our books. In our history class there are maps and other things on the wall which makes it look much more like a class room. There are many, many more things I would like to tell you but I shall save it for next time. /I told mama you liked the flowers and the corsages and she looked very pleased. Mama made the flowers and my brother, Richard, made the corsages. He is good at that sort of thing because he has been working in flower shops in San Diego and also in Los Angeles./Yes, I remember the dolls that are put up on ""O Hina Matsuri"" and I am sure you can use the geta for something. You may even be able to do something with it and wear it as a little pin. William was very proud of the name pin he made for you and when I told him how much you liked it and how you were going to wear it, he beamed up like a little kid. Yes, the heart would make a very lovely pin. I was trying to make a pin too but I cut my finger so I decided to let it go. If I ever go into carving again I shall remember to make you a cute little teddy bear pin which I think you will love. This is not a promise because I still want my fingers in good shape. /Everyone asked me to give you their best regards and they hope you had a nice, enjoyable holiday. /I certainly hope this war is going to be over soon, so that we can all go back into our old mode of living. When we come back to San Diego we shall be sure to look you up because you are one person no one could forget. You have a heart of gold and you believe in making other people happy. I am going to school and I have some homework to complete so I will close now but first I would like to tell you how much I enjoyed reading your letter./Please write me soon because I shall always be","Letter to Clara Breed from Hisako Watanabe, Poston, Arizona, January 7, 1943","Watanabe, Hisako",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Transcription:<br>January 6, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Thank you very much for your lovely letter./My mother was very happy to know you enjoyed the flowers and the silk. Please do not return the silk to me as nothing in this world is too big to give you! Just a few yards of silk is much too little for one who has made Florence and me truly happy and grateful./Perhaps if you keep at your garden you can have a Victory Garden and plant your vegetables and flowers in a ""V"" shape./I guess even if we Japanese are in camps we are much more fortunate when it comes to food for we get our share of meat, butter and eggs at least twice a week. Incidentally do you have horse meat in butcher shops yet? One of my teachers who went home for Christmas vacation said that food had gotten so high that she too was glad to be in here. /I guess the little children will have to replace ice cubes for ice cream soon if you can't have it unless you buy a sundae. I know coffee-lovers are certainly suffering because sugar is rationed and cream and coffee are certainly hard to get at present./Soon, I believe we San Diegans are going to get clothing allotments again and I am very happy. I wonder if this is a rumor or not but is Marstons going to close?/Thomas is in the best of health and just won't stay still. Already he will walk with the aid of something but I doubt whether he will walk before his birthday because of his weight--a good 30 pounds.

Transcription:<br>January 18, 1943 / Dear Miss Breed, / Thank you very kindly for sending me such a worthwhile book. History being my favorite and biographies being my favorite reading, ""There Were Giants in the Land"" is certainly a two in one book. A few authors are familiar to me; and I agree 100 per cent with Mr. Morgenthau's introduction. By reading this book, I can learn what these 28 giants did for us Americans. / Today has certainly been dusting and chilly throughout the day. The weather here has been very changeable lately. How is the weather in San Diego? / Florence drew you a picture of a house with an apple tree and flowers on each side. She hopes you will like it. It will not be long before Thomas becomes a year old. He is growing bigger day by day. Whenever I write about Thomas I just wish I could send you a snapshot of him. He has not taken one picture, but I can remember him as a baby even now. / I am sending you a copy of our school news paper.

I tried catching some, but it didn't work out. So now you needn't be in fear that I shall send you any./I doubt if we have skinks out here. There may be some though.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Helen McNary.  Transcription:<br>January 27, 1943/Dear Miss McNary,/Instead of going to school today I am sitting at home writing letters. Now Miss McNary, please don't come to an conclusion until you hear my explanation. Since Saturday Poston has been having a rainy weather. Today it is raining and raining. Because of the ground we are not able to go to school./The soil of Poston is very peculiar. When it rains, about an inch of the soil dampens. When you walk on it, the inch of mud clings to your shoe. As you lift your foot, you can see the dry soil underneath. Because the ground does not absorb the water we have a lake surrounding us--all the water is flowing on top of the mud. This may sound strange but it is a fact./On days like this I catch up on my  or mending. Often I sit listening to the rain as it hits against the roof. As I sit listening to the rain, everything of the past comes before my eyes like a movie. Then I sigh and go about my work./Miss McNary, you don't know how much I enjoyed your letter. I was so interested in hearing about San Diego that I did not even hear the dinner bell ringing. I was the last one to enter the mess hall. Thank you for writing such a clear, interesting description of the new San Diego. Yes, San Diego certainly has changed./I have hear that there was a fire at the Buddhist Temple. Was it a very large fire? Do you know how badly is was burned? We have been quite worried because all our belongings we left behind were stored at the Buddhist Temple. I certainly hope the damage wasn't too great./I would like to thank you for the cute spoon doll. Did you make it? It certainly is a clever idea and so cute./January 19th I attended the memorable ""ground breaking"" ceremony. At this time, Mr. Head, project director of Poston; Mr. Burge, director of Camp III; Dr. Carey, superintendent of schools in Poston; Mr. Potts, principal of Poston III High School drove a steak into the ground where the new school is going to be built. The first school flag was raised by the Senior class president, Lots Ishida. The school is going to be built out of adobe brick. These adobe bricks are going to be made right here in Poston./ One disappointing thing which happened here is the building of the fence. I think this tends to weaken the morale of the people./A ""tofu"" factory has finally been established. Tofu is loved by all our parents. It is made from soya beans./The food shortage and rationing has affected us too. Egg and butter have disappeared from the tables. Once in a great while do we see a little cube of butter. Sugar is limited to 1 teaspoon for breakfast. We have plenty of vegetables because every block grows vegetables which is given to the mess hall./I have heard we will be eating horse meat here soon. Are the on the market outside? It is said to be very tender./I just returned from lunch. I practically wadded and entered the mess hall. When I entered, my eyes nearly popped out. It looked as if/the floor was removed and the tables were set right on top of the mud. I certainly feel sorry for the janitor who'll have to clean the mess!/I always talk on and on about myself and never stop to ask about you. Please write during your leisure hours and elaborate, as my teacher says, about yourself./Hoping to hear you are in the finest of health!/Most sincerely,/Louise Ogawa","Letter to Helen McNary from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, January 27, 1943","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>January 6, 1942 / Dear Miss Breed, / I received the sweater and my brother's shorts. Thank you very very much for going through so much trouble for me. You need not have hurried in buying them. I wish you had shopped during your leisure time. Thank you again. The shorts are just fine. They fit perfectly. My sweater is excellent. I just love it!!! I am sorry I did not mention the price. Hearing that sweaters have gone up I did not write the price. No, you need not worry about the cost because I intended to pay about that much. / I was very glad to hear you liked the flowers. I wish I could have sent 10 dozen Am. beauty roses (red ones) to show my appreciation for everything you have done for me. / In my last letter I said the fence was torn down--well, it is up again. This time a few feet further out. We have been told that the reason for the fence building was so the cattle won't come near our homes. In other words cattle is going to be grazed outside the fence. But as yet, we have not seen any. Yes, I think the fence tends to weaken the morale of the people. / New Year's I attended the New Year Festival which was held in Camp II. It was held 3 days, Jan. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. There were various exhibits. The Camp II Industry exhibit--displayed various kinds of things made by the department. Education was very interesting too. There the work of the school children were displayed. Agriculture was another. In this building were many different kinds of vegetation. They were very green and looked as fresh as a daisy. The one I enjoyed most was the Arts and Craft. The longest line was in front of this building. My girl friend and I actually waited half an hour in line. It was worth the waiting time, I thought. Men have gone to cut mesquite trees and have made lovely flower vases out of them. The crooked branches and the bumpiest ones make the prettiest vases. In the vases there were many varieties of artificial flowers. Many beautiful canes were made too. Such things as ash trays, book ends, pencil holders, fruit baskets, vases, little jewelry chests, and crocket and checker sets were made out of mesquite. / When we saw the rolls and rolls of beautiful artificial flowers--chrysanthimums / in a green house, after standing in the hot sun, it gave us a refreshing feeling. I wish you could have been there. / We had our annual ""mochi tsuki""; making rice cakes. Our parents were very happy to be able to eat ""mochi"" again. No one ever dreamed of eating them again. The govt. is very good to us and I am truly grateful. / We now have oil stoves in our homes and school. But it does little good because you have to be near the stove in order to receive any heat. By keeping all the windows closed the room may become warm, but we were warned against it. Several people have been sent to the hospital because they did not leave any windows open -- they inhaled the fume which comes out of the stove. / In school the stove is in one corner and I am in the opposite corner so the warmth does not come near me. It certainly took a long time to get the stoves because of too much red tape involved. We still have no books to study out of. We are taught the progressive way. It is like a lecture form. / The teacher talks and we take notes. When test time comes we have to study our notes. I hope by next semester we will be able to study from books. / I have been having trouble about my credits because we did not get credit for the last semesters work. I am lacking 1/2 credit for graduation this June. But with the help of our Vice principal, Mr. Tashiro, I will be able to graduate. / We now have a school constitution. A student from each Case Studies class (history and English classes) formed the Constitutional Convention. At the present time it is being ratified. Next week we are going to have election of Student Body officers. / This morning we had an assembly at which time we had the opportu","Letter to Clara Breed from Louis Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, January 6, 1942","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Last year, being an experimental school year, things couldn't be helped being muddled as they were. At the present time Miss Cushman is trying to have the school credited through the Arizona State Education Division. In this way it will help the students when they relocate to schools in the outside. I certainly would like to be in school this year! When was it that I said I'll never want to go back to school??????? I wonder..../We are having a Xmas Bazaar in order to raise funds to buy toys for the children this Christmas. There is not much to the Bazaar except the various exhibits on display. It seems that most of the merchandise ordered for this affair did not arrive. But with the present condition as they are it cannot be helped. My, I certainly am rusty on the typewriter! How did I ever pass in typing!/How is the weather in San Diego? Here in Poston it is getting colder as the days go by. The other day the average temperature in the classroom was 40o. My goodness, pretty soon I will be a snow-girl../I imagine all the store windows are being decorated with Christmas trimmings since Christmas is slowly drawing near. I'll certainly miss the window shopping I use to love!!!!!!!/Will you tell Miss Breed that I had the pleasure of meeting the Jr. Red Cross Field Representative from San Francisco. I told me that she had dinner with Miss Breed before coming to Poston. I shall write to her very soon--at least I shall try. Please give her my regards./Well, do take care of yourself for the winter days are here! Here's hoping you will write soon./Most sincerely,/Louise Ogawa","Letter to Helen McNary from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, December 5, 1943","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

I suppose my brother wrote to you about my being out here in Preston. I didn't plan to come out here on an indefinite. It all started when I went to Ogden, Utah with a group of girls to work at the cannery peeling tomatoes. This work was to last about a month--when that was completed I decided to visit the Obayashi family in Idaho since it was only a few hours ride. /Unexpectedly I was offered a job at Paul's Cafe. The salary of $80.00 a month dazzled me so I accepted. The boss, Mr. Merrill is very nice--he has two boys in the Navy. Farrell, the younger son is home on a 9 day leave. He (Farrel) has a wife and a two months old boy--looks just like his grandfather./The weather out here is quite a change from the warm climate of California and Arizona. It snows quite often now. Just hope it stays like this and we'll really have a white Christmas./The young people have a regular ice skating rink here, and I'm sure making good use of it. I'm planning to take some skiing lessons as soon as I find time./I'm staying at a small rooming house. Mrs. Struves, my land lady, is a very sweet woman. She has ten children, four girls and six boys. Three of her boys and two girls are in California. One of her sons is married to Mrs. Merrill's sister. I don't know how many grandchildren she has--I'll know for sure when they all get together for Christmas eve./Well I'll have to close for now. It's almost time for me to go to work./Yaeko/P.S.

Transcription:<br>323-11-D/Poston, Arizona/August 23, 1943/Dear Miss Breed, /Gee, it's very hard for me to start this letter--it's mighty mighty overdue. First before any explanations are offered, thank you very much for sending me the books, the snaps, hook and eyes, the magazine, the cross word puzzles, and your nice long letter. Gee, all that and not even a note of thank you from me. Gee, I'm terrible. /This time, however, I've got an excuse. Will you listen? Thanks. The day I was going to write to you, my b.f. from Layton, Utah dropped in. I was, needless to say, more than surprised and all agog! He is a fellow I went around with in S.A. (I mean Santa Anita!) We went together--off and on over there--but it wasn't very serious at the time. But, now that I've seen him again and realize that he came all the way from Utah I feel like that song ""It Started All Over Again--The moment I looked in your eyes, etc."" It seems to me ""I've got it bad--and that ain't good!"" Let me tell you about him--he's about 5' 8"", dark got a nice shaped head--looks like Ronald Reagan in a crude sort of way, has bushy eyebrows, black hair and a swell smile. I think he is pretty nice, but he is so young--only 20! That's the same age as I am except he is 9 months older. He would like to marry me some day--perhaps in two or three years. So far as that is concerned it's OK with me, but what has me rather puzzled and has set me thinking is that he has no other future than farming. I am wondering if I could fit into that pattern of living and like it. I have never done much housework and I've never done any farming of any kind. /I always thought that I was mature, but when I have hit a crisis like this I feel like a two year old. I can see all my shortcomings (which is rather a shock to find oneself so incompetent) and wonder if people could ever want me for a wife. Mother doesn't think it's so serious yet. She thinks it's just a crush. I often wonder about this./I keep telling Jim (which by the way is his name) that I don't know if it's real. It's so confusing that I just don't know what to do. Some day my heart and soul will get together and tell me what to do. Until then I'm not giving him any answer./Gosh, you must be tired of reading all about my troubles, but it helps to tell someone who understands and can see more clearly than I, who am in the midst of it. /According to the latest visitor who returned from Santa Fe, my father has had his rehearing and may be able to join us soon. We are anticipating news of the outcome of his rehearing. We hope and pray that he will rejoin us soon./I have enclosed a section of the paper which has an article about your kind donation to our libraries. It is gratifying to know that someone outside thinks of us./August 24, 1943/We did some exercises in the office this morning, so I feel rather stiff. I must keep up the exercise, though to keep me trim. /About a month ago I weighed myself for the first time since S.A. Yours truly weighs 92# which is 5# less than in S.A. and S.D. It makes me feel good to think I lost some. I've also grown about 1/4""--not much but good for my morale. Have you lost weight after working so hard?/My sister is married to Bill Katayama of Los Angeles, who ran a fruit stand there. They will be married 2 years this 31st. We have yet to be together on their wedding anniversary. Last year we left them in Santa Anita three days before their first anniversary! Were we disgusted--they had a get together with lots of good food--especially shrimp salad! We came out here and had weiners!/Next Sunday will be exactly one year since our arrival here. About all I can say is this place certainly has improved since our coming in. There is much more greenery and it looks lived in./Sunday night there was an O-bon odori which is some sort of Buddhist celebration.

Morning worship, followed by a picnic lunch. Then we heard a panel discussion about the opportunities and qualifications of missionaries. The evening service began with vesper hour then evening worship. It was a fairly tiring day, but I enjoyed every moment of my first conference. /I too wish that you may visit Poston!

"1 letter and envelope from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>August 27, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/There is an old saying, ""Tempus fugit."" How true--I have just awoken to the fact that quite a number of months have flown by since I last wrote to you. Since I started work May 17 as a barber (the only one in Camp III until three weeks ago) time has gone by so fast that it scares me. Because we're so busy at the shop the work hours simply fly. Usually I find myself quite tired after a day's work so that whenever I have any spare time I lie down and catnap. Luckily I get most of the afternoon off because of the heat./Speaking of the heat--July was terrific!!! Once for a whole week the maximum outside temperature was never below 125. If I remember correctly the extreme (outside) maximum for that week was over 154 (125 in the shade) on a Sunday afternoon. The inside of my room was always around 110 to 124 during those afternoons (Temp at night 90-100). Any exertion such as lying down and resting cause sweat to pour out in rivulets! It isn't so bad now as the temperature is only around 107-105. However the morning gets awfully cold between 3:30 to 4:00 AM. It drops to 69--enough to wake me up shivering for a blanket./I have been taking music lessons for my ukelele almost every night for almost two months. I walk 2/3 of a mile to the other end of the camp to get my lessons from a Hawaiian boy. As yet I have no ""ear"" and it's really a treat to watch and hear him play both the guitar and the ukelele. /During the latter part of July and up to last Monday we have had quite a thrilling finale to the first round of the Block League in softball. Our Block 322-323 team emerged the League Champions and then proceeded to take the trophy in a playoff among the four top teams of the League. The playoff victory was a no-hit no-run 1-0 thriller pitched by a former Coronado boy Akira Takeshita. The San Diego boys have proven themselves as outstanding ballplayers./On the last day of July we were at the weekly (16 mm.) movie (outdoors at night). There was a big crowd because the feature film was Glenn Miller's ""Orchestra Wives."" Just as the main feature came on the screen we were suddenly engulfed in a duststorm! One minute a clear night--the next minute a howling wind that carried so much dust that the stars above were blotted out. Even the street lights were dimmed by the dust. We hadn't seen dust like that since January./Our next big storm was on August 16. It was a veritable cloudburst. Raindrops were about the size of jumbo size peas. In the short half-hour downpour, which was accompanied by a fierce north wind that threatened to blow off the barrack roofs, fell all the rain of Poston's rainy season. Our block was flooded with water over six inches deep on our corner (Barracks 12-13-14 and messhall). The storm raised havoc with our uncompleted school buildings made of adobe. Three of the school buildings had their roofs blown off. The reason for that was that the windows had not been put in so the wind just came in on the open side and pushed upward to lift off the roof. You see, the whole north side of the school building is made up of windows from the roof to average window sill height. [illustration of school building] That's about how they look. You have to see them though to really appreciate what the evacuee laborers have done with adobe to build a modernistic school building./The units that already had the windows withstood the full force of the wind and rain. 500 baby chicks were killed by the storm and more to die was the report of the poultry department. The community activitie's outdoor stage in the process of construction was shorn of it's adobe walls by the fierce wind and rain./Gosh after a ""dead"" summer it surely gave us something to talk about. The huge forks of lightning were beautiful and the rolling thunder terrifying--nature in the raw. I really liked it./Well, this makes one year that I've been in Poston.--a","Letter to Clara Breed from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki, Poston, Arizona, August 27, 1943","Hirasaki, Tetsuzo",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"A letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa written to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>March 20, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/I never seem to be able to keep my word of writing to you often--one thing or another keeps me from writing. This time it was that sweet 5 letter word ""TESTS."" Though in camp, school life has not changed for we still have final exams. I am now in my last semester of school. I can hardly wait for June--graduation./As I have told us before we had our ditch day and Apr. 3rd is the Jr. Sr. Prom. All the buzz buzz buzzing around school are the bee hives of girls chattering about their clothes for the Prom./<br>School has become quite a sad place now since the camouflage factory began. It has taken six of our faculty. Now the administration is short of teachers./After writing 16 lines, it's about time I asked you, how you are. Still your jolly, merry self I hope! How are your eyes? I heard they were bothering you. I do hope everything is alright!! We are all just fine here in Poston. We are beginning to feel the effects of the sun again. It is quite warm in the mornings and quite hot in the afternoons./March 22, 1943/After a brief intermission I am once again sitting at my desk writing to you. I hope today finds you  much merrier and happier than yesterday./Thank you ever so much for the ""Library Journal""! The article you wrote was very interesting. My father was having a hectic time trying to read it. Then all of a sudden he asked ""I wonder who wrote these letters?"" Curious to know what he was talking about I began to read it - taking it rudely from father. To my astonishment they were a part of my letter I wrote to you. I guess father knew the answer to his question by my surprised expression and flustered face. He uttered, ""That's alright. The truth never hurts."" Miss Breed, I was quite surprised, thrilled, yet embarrased to see it in black and white because of my poor English. Thank you for sending the article to me. I certainly would like to keep it./Miss Breed, thank you for the wonderful time I had with you last night! I think I better start from the beginning before you think I am not in the right state of mind. I had a wonderful dream last night. I left Poston on a short leave of absence and headed for good old San Diego and to you. My first stop after leaving the train was a candy store and you were right behind me too. There I saw rolls and rolls of candy. I kept asking you, ""Would this chocolate candy melt before I reach home?"" Before anyone could say ""a ____"" I asked for 5 lbs. of it. I was buying the whole store yet I left the store with the same amount of money I had when I entered it. That was because I never paid. I don't know how I got away with it either. Then I went into the Mayor's office and had my picture taken. It was the first picture I took since evacuation (11 months). Oh, everyone treated me so kindly and they were so friendly. I painted the town red, as the saying goes. Yes, I went everywhere--I went to Marstons and Lions for my clothes; Hamilton for all the cakes, cookies and what have you; Jessop for all the rings for all my fingers and wrist watches placed one after another until it reached my shoulder; Boldricks for shoes; haunted the drive inns every night for a nice juicy steak, ice cream sodas, banana splits by the dozens.--oh, I had a wonderful time!! Then by 6:00 A.M. I was back in my Poston cot again. When I awoke this morning I wondered if it really happened or if it was another one of those wild fantastic dreams. It was so realistic I began to wonder./Now to tell you other things besides fairy tales. This Poston weather certainly is unpredictable! This morning it was very clear with a cool breeze rushing here and there. Then about 10:00 A.M. the mean old wind together with the sand began to blow. It blew and blew until we couldn't see the barracks near by. We had a terrible time trying to go home for lunch. The wind wanted us to go to the north and we wanted to go to the south.

Indeed, you write some of the most interesting letters I ever read./I was surprised to hear that there were scorpions in San Diego. I never saw any or heard anything of a scorpion until I came here, but I still have to see a real live scorpion. My mother says they move very fast./I wonder if I told you that we gave some of the seeds away. (I mean the ones you sent me for Christmas.) I just have one left. I wanted to plant them very much, but my mother was busy and I couldn't possibly plant them by myself. However, since my mother has more time, (she quit her job.) we may be able to plant both seeds this summer./However, as we are planning to go out, we mine as well take them with us. We don't know as yet where we can go, but if there is a suitable job someplace, we are going. That is why mother quit her job as head waitress and stewardess. /School is fine, but my grade is dropping. It is hard to work in this warm weather./Going back to the seeds again, they bloomed nicely they were very beautiful. I hear that this was the only block that has such beautiful flowers.

The clipping was very welcome since several of my friends working with me in the mess hall used to attend the Buddhist Church. / My partner in dishwashing is a young Seattle Nisei. He had been out on seasonal leave in Ogden when recruiting for harvest work started in Utah. He is quite a nice fellow. We dishwash one day and pot wash the next. There are five of us in the crew. All but this young chap in the mess hall are Postonites of III. Oh, there is one fellow from Camp II. / It rained a bit today. Saw a full rainbow this afternoon, the first in quite a number of years. / Could you send me a road map of Calif. + Oregon as I would like to use it on homeward trip? / Sincerely     Ted.","Postcard to Clara Breed from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki, Newell, California, November 19, 1943","Hirasaki, Tetsuzo",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Transcription:<br>December 22, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/We received your packages today and we were all very glad to receive them./I can not tell you how much we appreciate all you have done to make our life here pleasant. I wish we could send you something worthwhile but it is very hard to get anything./My parents seemed even more over-joyed than we were to see all the gifts you had sent us. In times like this, it really makes one feel good to know he has a friend./Jack was very happy when he saw the book and he has started reading it already. My other brothers and I were also speechless upon seeing the presents. /Candy is another thing which is hard to get. We all appreciated the candy, gum, and books and wish we could do something to make your Christmas just as pleasant as you have made ours./As you have probably heard many people are leaving camp to go to work or school. I have been wanting to relocate also and I have hopes of going out maybe by the first of the year. At any rate, I will continue to correspond with you./My, how thoughtless of me. I have been talking about myself and I haven't even asked you anything about yourself. How are you and how is your work coming along? I believe you are get quite busy./By the way, how is the little city of San Diego? I suppose there are a lot of people and housing conditions are probably very bad./Do you know just about how much it would cost to buy a nice box coat (beige)? Also the price of a two-piece suit? You see, the reason I am inquiring is because I want to get a coat and suit depending upon the price. If it costs too much I will have to save a little more money./How is the weather there? Here in Poston it is very cold in the mornings and nights and warm in the afternoons. We had a little rain about two days ago./Our school this year is very nice. The adobe rooms are warm in winter and cool in the summer. The children enjoy school more and they are really interested. My brother really studies hard this year. /Do you have a discarded dictionary that you might be able to send me. I would like to have one and thought maybe you might have an old discarded one that I could use./Since it is getting quite late, I will close but before closing please let me thank you again for all the nice presents. We all appreciate it very much./Yours sincerely,/Hisako Watanabe/P.S. Please write real soon.

Things have been popping rather fast lately. A (dust) windstorm, a cold spell, a rainstorm, and good news./The duststorm came during the third week of January and lasted for three days. It was alomst as bad as the Christmas storm. Following that on the morning of Jan. 20 we had the coldest morning yet when the temp. dropped to 20. That whole day ice was on the ground. It wasn't until the next afternoon before it thawed. Then on the 23rd it began to rain. It poured cloudburst after cloudburst for three days. The  dust just turned into the stickiest mud I have ever seen. It was during the same storm that you had that bad blow in San Diego. From the pictures in the clippings it must have been quite a blow. /When the Army came here to Camp III to register the men under selective service and also to take volunteers for the Japanese American Combat Unit, it was the best piece of news we nisei have had in a long time. We nisei were despairing in ever becoming recognized. But now we have the chance to prove our loyalty, because after the evacuation, nisei were classed as aliens inelegible for military service./I am proud to say that the San Diego group has the most volunteers than any other group in camp. All together in our block we have just about 15 volunteers including yours truly, which makes about the best record yet. We are going around Feb 23 to (according to those ""in the know"") to Camp Douglas, Utah (near Salt Lake City) for induction that to Camp Shelby Mississippi (this much is official) for training. This is the bunch to be with because we are all volunteers and there won't be those slackers and pro-axis minded as there would be if the men were drafted. Yessirree all of us are itching to go. /I also received news that the men in internment are possibly slated for rehearings according to a friend of mine who visited the Lordsburg New Mexico Internment Camp. just recently. He said he talked to my father and that he was looking fine. Treatment of the interned men is very fine. /I have been writing to a number of people for affidavits as I want my father to be eligible for a rehearing and a possible parole so that he can come to Poston to be with Yaeko. While I'm gone./So-----if everything goes well I'll be writing to you from an Army Camp instead of a relocation center./Sincerely yours/Ted.<br>","Letter to Clara Breed from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki, Poston, Arizona, February 19, 1943","Hirasaki, Tetsuzo",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Thanks a million for your lovely Christmas card. C. Newberry certainly illustrates kittens very nicely. I have read many of her books, such as ""Mittens"" and etc. Are you busy these days? Are you preparing materials for your summer reading program which your library carries on each summer? I know it is very helpful to the children. I remember when I was young and went t the library during the summer to see how many books we could read. /I am still teaching the fourth grade alone. I enjoy it very much. It is much harder to work alone but I don't mind it at all. / Do you remember my younger brother, Paul? He recently volunteered for the new American-Japanese Combat Unit in the U. S. Army. He will leave soon for his physical exam and then to Mississippi. There were about 60 from our camp and half of them were former San Diego boys. I believe Tetsuzo Hirasaki volunteered, also the Obayashis./It will be sad to see my brother off, but I am sure that he is doing his part to win the war for the Allies. /This summer, that is, in August, the teachers here are going to attend summer school in Fort Apache Reservation. This is by Globe and Hollbrook, Arizona. It is on high altitude so perhaps, it will not be as hot as in Poston. It has already become pretty warm in the afternoons here.

Poston would be much better if it were not for the warm weather, dust and especially the insects that fly in as soon as the lights go on. /Our principal, Mr. Chester Potts, planned a way in which we students may become acquainted with one another by having different clubs organized. This is only the second week, but I know they are going to be successful. Each faculty member has a different club which meets on certain days of the week. Louise and I joined the Reading Club which meets on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. In this club, we read the books of the month and learn about authors. Reading is one of my hobbies so I know I will enjoy this club. On Tuesday and Thursday I go to my Commercial Club. This club has already begun a constitution. We are going to have typing and shorthand contests in which we may receive awards. This club will aid and tend to familiarize the members in the business world. /Thomas is getting so that he walks all over Block 322.

"2 letters and envelope from Margaret and Florence Ishino to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>July 25, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/I was so glad to hear from you after such a long time! How are you?/Florence was so happy about the beautiful book you sent her that she showed it to all her friends. In her spare time she is always reading it and keeps and eye on Thomas so he will not take it. I began reading my book as soon as I got it and went on a three hour mystery hunt to find out the river secret. Imagine my surprise to find out that Andy was the lost child and that Miss Montgomery was a Federal Agent. This story reminded me of the Colorado River. There is an elderly man down at river who built himself a shack on the bank. Inside his little shack he has a bed, table and a few chairs, all which he made himself. He comes back to the ""mainland"" once a week to get his food. Whenever I go down to the river I see him and often wonder why he lives there with a family in camp. He seems to be a very cheerful man and is an excellent fisherman; cooks his fish deliciously./Poston is so warm that I think of Little Black Sambo when the tigers ran around the tree so fast that they made butter out of themselves. If this weather keeps up the Japanese in Poston will be butter. They say only horses sweat, but I'm ""sweating"" every day. It is a 120 in the shade at the present time./Thomas is still as mischievous as ever, but is learning new things. He will shake hands with anyone who asks him. Once you ask you will do it over and over. He will tell you his age by putting up one finger. He is just a little monkey and tries to copy us all the time. /The teachers here are going to Fort Apache, an Indian village near Phoenix. Three students are going along as ""guinea pigs"" I certainly wish I was going with them.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>Sept. 14, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/With school starting Monday I'd say I'm almost as busy as you. But I'll always have time for your delightful letters!/Yes, I can imagine the fun you had picking and canning figs because I use to pick figs too. In our backyard we use to have a fig tree--there never was a time that I wasn't caught on a limb while picking figs./Because in a camp I do not feel very much of the effects of war but hearing about all the difficulties is enough for me. I do hope sweaters are still available! Oh, oh, this means more trouble for you! You know it! --Tough luck, as the Postonians would say at this time. You see, I want a sweater as you may have already guessed. When you happen to go shopping, I don't care when, will you kindly look around for a cartigan sweater for me please. I would like it in some shade of rose. But not pink please because the Poston sun is too strong for it. Dusty rose, rose, Am. beauty rose anything in shades of rose will do. I am enclosing two strips of yarn--these colors are fine too. My, what a particular girl I am! Yes, I agree!! If this color is or rather cannot be found medium blue will do. But not navy blue please. I am a fine one aren't I? I ask and at the same time I send the money so you can't refuse. Please remember I am in NO HURRY. In fact I'd like to receive it around the end of October--then the crickets won't get it and because I am in no urgent need of it. I thought I'd enclose the money now so that just in case one was found I'll have it. And there'll be no chance of losing it by waiting until later. And also I have heard that the quality of goods are becoming very poor. The sweater may be priced up to $4.50 because after including the tax, postage etc. it'll amount to $5.00, which is the amount enclosed for the sweater. Oh yes about the style--sloppy Joe is just fine./I won't apologize to you for being such a pest again because I always seem to apologize and then ask a favor of you the next minute. I'm glad to hear the incident of the clock and I amused you but you would have heard tingle lingle ling of your neck if you had laughed at the moment it occurred./I guess you were right about Miss McNary not being able to compete against me they don't come any blacker than I!!/My but that iron certainly came as a pleasant surprise! Thanks a million for going through much trouble to purchase it for me. Thank you !!!! I am enclosing $7.00 in money order for the iron. This is how I came to that conclusion--$6.50 was the cost of the iron; 35 c. was the cost of the postage; 15 c., which is a measly (? --&gt; spelling) sum in the cost of the streetcar fare = $7.00/About our old iron, father thought it best not to send it for repairs because we had it repaired twice already and the repairman informed us of its short life. /Most of my friends who have relocated seem to end up working for some kind of a publishing company. They always write and say how friendly everyone is, though once in a while they do meet some unfriendly people but that is to be expected anywhere./Yes, I'm quite sure it takes loads of courage to go out into the spacious United States again. But I think those who have relocated have advanced one step above us. Here in camp, I think our standard of living tends to become lower, we tend to become less independent, and this certainly does not help to make our future brighter. This may not be altogether true, but it's my opinion. I certainly would like to go out, but I don't have the slightest idea where I'd like to go. I guess I haven't really given it much thought, since father has not consented to my going. My sister is planning to go out but as yet she has no definite plans. She may go to Chicago where my brother is. Father says he would like to go out too but he is a little optimistic about the feelings toward him since he is an isei.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>August 17, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/It seems our letters have crossed in the mail because I received your letter the day after I sent mine.<br>/But I hope this letter finds you in the best of health./This time I won't mention the heat because we had a nice long down-pour of rain yesterday./Yesterday morning was a little cloudy but soon the sun came around the mountain and began beaming down at us. Everyone went to work expecting another hot day. The sun beamed and beamed until about 2 o'clock in the afternoon when suddenly it became cloudy and began to pour. It didn't start out with a sprinkle either. It just began to pour. Then we had the regular formalities of a rain storm--thunder, wind, lightning. The Poston thunder certainly is loud! But father slept through it for an hour. He must have been really tired or else he is a really sound sleeper. The lightning here is just beautiful. You can see each jagged corner distinctly./The worst part of the storm was the whirl wind. It rushed the rain against the side of the barracks and down came the rain into the house, through the cracks in the wall. I rushed to the rescue of my clothes and a few odds and ends which were against the wall. Then I went running to the flood on my dresser carrying a pan. Oh, what a disgust! When there is a dust storm, the sand comes in through the cracks; when it rains, the rain comes in through the same cracks. Well, that's life I guess./When I glanced out the window, it reminded me of the Mississippi flood. The firebreak had become a river. Many of the so-called puddles being knee deep, I saw lots and lots of people wading home in their bare feet. I wish you could have been here to see what went on. I just can't express myself./Today the sun is brightly shining just as if nothing had happened. I know the ground will soon be hard and dry again./The Poston wind is very strong. I understand that some of the roofs of the newly built adobe school buildings came flying down./I was very interested to hear that San Diego is now divided into postal districts. I can see how easier it is for the postman./Yes, I am still working at the school office. You may have heard that Mr. C. Potts has resigned the principalship of the Poston III Schools. Miss Frances S. Cushman has taken over the position as principal./A few weeks ago four new young teachers arrived. They are all just fresh from college. My fellow classmates, especially boys, are now sorry they graduated./All the teachers were going to go to a summer school at Fort Apache this month. But due to the ill-feelings of the people of Arizona towards us, it has been cancelled. It certainly was a great disappointment to everyone. But the already made plans are being carried through. Instead of going to Fort Apache they are going to Camp I for the summer session for teachers./I am sorry you were not able to located Emi. She is standing in the second row next to the end on the right hand side, as you face the picture./My brother in Chicago is working as a shipping clerk in a publishing firm. He seems to like his work and Chicago very much. He says because of the numerous factories, the city is very dirty. I guess, nothing can beat San Diego./Thank you very kindly for the clippings on the crepe paper novelties. I shall try to make some of the articles in my spare time./BOOM--my mind has become a complete blank./Most respectfully,/Louise Ogawa/","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, Augus 17, 1943","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Miss McNary sent me one, and I had one which a baby broke. If you please, I would much rather prefer the ones in book form, (which I think are available at Woolworth's) but if they can't be had, the ones that come in boxes are all right. I will send fifty cents which will cover the mailing cost as well as for the paper dolls./ I hope you don't think I'm asking too much of you./<br>Always with Love,/Katherine Tasaki/P.S./I have sent a sample dress to show you the kind of flap I want.

They both came in very fine shape; both come in very handy, too. As for the remaining 70 c. I wonder if you would buy some film and bring your camera. That is one thing everyone enjoys here--having their picture taken, I mean. I understand that that is hard to get, too./Last week Chiyo and I applied for the N.Y.A. Summer School for a course in clerical work. This school will probably be in Springfield, Illinois for those taking clerical work. It seems that we will get free room and board and education with $15.90 for spending money. We will probably live dormitory style. The encyclopedias here are so ancient (I guess I've told you that before!) that they probably don't have anything on the N.Y.A. All I know is that it is a government sponsored affair and had the sanction of Mrs. Roosevelt when it began in either 1932 or 1934. That's all I remember about it--and to think I wrote a term paper on it! I wonder if you have the time if you would look up some information on that subject? Thank you./About 19 families are preparing to leave for Texas to the family internment camp. A friend of mine visited her father and mother-in-law there, and gave a very interesting account of it. The accomodations sound very good--a stove, a living room and bedroom with furnishings. Each family is alloted so many coupons per week to purchase food, and each person is given $10 per month. It sounds very good, but the only things wrong are that once one goes in, he may not be able to get out; and also letters are censored. Escorts to Texas are supposed to arrive here today, and those who are leaving expect to go by next week. This is the first group, and all the fathers are already in Texas. The rest do not know when they will go because the fathers are not there yet. My father is still in Louisiana and at the present time has told me that I do not have to go to Texas unless I want to./May 24 (already!)/Gosh this heat is really something terrific! You'd better prepare for some mighty hot weather! Yesterday it was 130 outside! We can only only go to bed with 1 sheet on--nothing else!/Early this morning the first group left for Texas. I hope they have a nice trip and like it down there. This, though they call it a ""family"" internment camp, is really the beginning of the splitting up of many families. Young boys and girls are rather reluctant to go. One mother left today leaving her two sons, ages 19 and 17 here. How soon they will be able to join the folks is unknown. It really is a shame, but this is just the beginning of many family separations./ Enough for now. Please take good care of yourself and be sure to be able to ""take"" this heat.

When I came down to earth, I found exactly one dozen letters to answer./How have you been Miss Breed? Is the cold weather creeping up on you? It certainly is in Poston! The morning and evening temperature seem to disagree with my toes. We are gradually pulling out our sweaters and overcoats to welcome old man winter./Did you have a happy halloween? I don't imagine there was the usual gay celebration. Poston experienced a very quiet halloween. All the old folks stayed home near the oil stoves and the little children sound asleep, while the young folks enjoyed an evening of dancing./Now, I shall try to dig up some Poston news. Be patient with me because this is a very hard task! Let me see, the swimming pool was finally completed. But does anyone go swimming. NO. In the first place it is too cold and the second reason is that it is not as yet filled with water. At the present time the children's wading pool is being completed./The adobe school building is almost completed. I am waiting very anxiously for the completion of the administration building. I am enclosing a few of the school paper--I thought you might enjoy them. The school is so much nicer this year that I wish I didn't graduate so soon./The school is going to be so well equipped that I envy the students. The home economic classes are having sinks and stoves installed. Already a shipment of kitchen utensils, pots and pans, china dishes have arrived. The agriculture classes are going to provide the vegetables./The science classes this year will have lavatory equipments for experiments etc. The auto shop classes are getting model-T fords. Miss Cushman, the principal, is going all over Parker buying half-broken down cars from the indians. The boys seem to be having a grand time taking the old cars apart./The typing class this year has several typewriters though most of them need repairing. Last year the students had to bring their own typewriters. Yes, the school has made a wonderful improvement. We already had our first football game. The ""C"" team played against the Camp I ""C"". The large crowd was disappointed in the outcome for we lost but it was a wonderful game. The Arizona State inspectors arrived today to inspect the school to see if it can be credited to the State of Arizona Board of Education. The results are as yet unknown. I certainly hope it will be credited for the benefit of the students./I'd like to go through my senior year all over again, even in camp. I am just green with envy when I think of how lucky these students are this year--they have a new school, many young new teachers, loads of equipments.November 15, 1943/My goodness, your letter is still lying on my desk. I'll try very hard to get this in the mail before Xmas! /The atmosphere of the office certainly had changed this year compared to last year! It seems like an office, yes indeed! We now have name plates sitting on each of our desk. Mine reads:/Stenographer/Miss Y. Ogawa/It makes me feel so proud!

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>January 27, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/Tardily as usual I want to thank you very much for the most interesting book. I read the book in two hours. Once I started I could not stop reading it. Oh, I enjoyed it more than words can express./Today I am sitting at home writing letters instead of going to school. Now Miss Breed, please don't come to a conclusion until you hear my explanation. Since Saturday Poston has been having rainy weather. Today it is pouring cats and dogs. Because of the ground we are unable to attend school./The soil of Poston is very peculiar. When it rains, about an inch of the soil dampens. When you walk on it, the inch of mud clings to your shoe. As you lift your foot, you can see the dry sand underneath. Because the ground does not absorb the water we have a lake surrounding us.--all the water is floating on top of the mud. This may sound strange but it is a fact./On days like this I catch up on my  or mending. Often I sit listening to the rain as it hits against the roof./I have heard there was a fire at the Buddhist Temple. Was it a very big fire? Do you know how bad the damages were? We have been quite worried because all our belongings which we left behind, we left or stored it at the Buddhist Church. I certainly hope the damages were not too severe./We stored there such things as the World Book Encyclopedia, trunks, little of our furniture, other books, my Japanese kimono, a box of Japanese canned food which we planned to bring but was not able. If you know if all the things stored there were burned or not - I would appreciate it if will inform me. Father is quite worried./January 19th I attended the memorable ""ground breaking"" ceremony. At this time Mr. Head, project director of Poston; Mr. Burge, director of Camp III; Dr. Carey, superintendent of Poston schools; Mr. Potts, principal of Poston III High School drove the steak into the ground where the new school is going to be built. The first school flag was raised by the Senior Class president, Tots Ishida. The school is going to be built out of adobe bricks. The bricks are being made here./The ""tofu"" factory has finally been established. Tofu is loved by all our parents. It is made from soya beans./I have just returned from lunch. I practically waded through our lake and entered the mess hall. When I entered, my eyes nearly popped out. It looked as if the floor was removed and the tables and chairs were sit right on top of the mud. I certainly feel sorry for the janitor who will have to clean the terrible mess!/I always talk on and on about myself and never stop to ask about you. Please do write during your leisure hours for I always count the days until I hear from you./Most sincerely,/Louise Ogawa./I am enclosing the menu you asked for. Sorry it was delayed.

Transcription:<br>July 25, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/After a long intermission may I begin by thanking you from the bottom of my heart for the book, To Meet Miss Long, which I so greatly enjoyed. It certainly brought back many happy memories except for that first formal. I imagine if the world was not in such a turmoil I may have experienced that too./Miss Breed, every time ink starts flowing from my pen I seem to ask you to purchase this and that for me. I cannot tell you how much it hurts me to have to ask. My parent doesn't seem to understand how busy you are. My brother is now living in Chicago, Illinois. We asked him to purchase an iron for us since ours broke. He has tried for a month but it seems impossible to purchase one. Then we asked our soldier friends but again it failed. As a last resort I am asking you with my head bowed in shame for I know how busy you are./Miss Breed, I wonder if you know of any store or friend who might have an extra iron (second-hand or new). As the people of would say, we are desperate for an iron--any kind just so it is an iron. In a place like Poston where we change our clothes at least twice a day an iron is the most essential thing. Of it is at all possible to purchase one, please inform me and I shall send you the money immediately./Poston is still the same old, dusty town. It seems to be getting hotter by the minute. One of the caucasian teachers went home to Berkeley and when she returned she told us of the wonderful weather she enjoyed. It was cold, cloudy, rainy, and damp--everyone wearing their fur coats. We were certainly surprised to hear that because we just won't be able to stand the sight of a fur because it'll make us perspire all the more./I imagine San Diego is having a wonderful weather--just as it use to./Did you recognize any of us in that little snap-shot? Because it was so small I imagine it was of little use trying to make us out./Well slowly but surely I have come to the end of my rope.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>August 5, 1943 / Dear Miss Breed, / For the first time in my life I am speechless. I do not know what to say or how to begen to thank you for the ever so interesting book, The Blueberry Muffin, and for going through the tremendous trouble of sending the soaps to me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you Miss Breed. Thank you - Thank you - Thank you!!!! / With the summer season drawing to a close, I imagine you are getting ready for that mad rush of school children you have each year. But I do hope you are your fine, happy, cheerful self! I certainly wish I were one of those happy children rushing to your desk with a wagon load of books to check out. / We are all just fine and dandy here in hot Poston. I am still one of those Indians residing at Blk. 328-11-a. Whether it rains or snows across the border, the sun still shines in Poston! When I first entered this camp, I thought the heat was unbearable. Already July (known as the hottest month) has come and gone. We must have become accustomed to this heat because I don't think it is as hot as it was last year. I better knock on wood for I may be speaking a little too soon. / Well, I never thought I would be going three times just to see one movie. But I did!!! Friday, July 31st our movie night, I took my little home made chair to the scene of the movie. After a long boresome waiting, the screen was put up and finally the show was on. The movie was ""Ochestra Wives"". After seeing one reel, a heavy wind suddenly came blowing by and what do you think it did? It just tore the poor white screen right in half. So we picked up our chairs and off for home we trotted. We were very much disgusted. / Then Saturday night again we went to see the movie. But we came home angry as a bear for we saw nothing. The movie crew did not show up from Camp I. / Then came Sunday night. We slowly approached the movie location and hesitatingly sat down on our chairs. Well, to our suprise and joy we did see the movie that night. It was a very enjoyable musical picture. We went home feeling as happy as a lark. But I hope I'll never have to go 3 times to see one movie again. / Tomorrow night's movie is ""Henry Aldrich, Editor"". I am hoping and praying this will be the first and the last time we see it. / At the present time linoleums are being laid on the floors. But the catch is that we have to lay them ourselves. And that is what you call WORK. I imagine we'll lay ours in before next summer. / A very funny incident occurred on the night of the movie. There was such a heavy wind that night, that the electricity was turned off. Our electric clock stopped too. Now this was tragic for without that clock father would never get up at 5:00 A.M. to go to work. So with a useless flashlight in one hand and with a make-believe candle in the other hand I hunted high and low for the old faithful alarm clock. After a vigorous search, it was finally found. Then father had a wonderful time lighting one match after another while I ""calmly"" tried to adjust the alarm clock. Hot diggity dogs! I finally succeeded. Then what happens???? The lights go on. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. That was to hold our temper. We were so disgusted all we could do was laugh. / The crickets here certainly keep me busy! I work from 8:00 A.M. til 5:00 P.M. When I come home, I have a pile of clothes waiting to be mended. Every time I wash new holes stare me in the face. My, but we have the most hungriest crickets here in Poston. They eat everything--from shirts and blouses to panties. / As the cool wind comes blowing through my window, so goes the news. So until I write again the best of luck to you always. / Most respectfully, / Louise Ogawa / Please give my regards to Miss McNary","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, August 5, 1943","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed + senior week schedule  Transcription:<br>June 28, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/Well, finally I made the grade for graduation day has come and gone. Commencement was held on June 26th, 9:30 P.M. at the newly built amphitheater. All the girls wore sheer, cotton pastel dresses while the boys wore white shirts, dark pants, and dark ties./I am enclosing a commencement exercise program. I thought may be you will enjoy seeing it. Also I am enclosing a copy of the activities we enjoyed during senior week./We were very disappointed in being forced to change the hours of the river party. Becuase of the Dies Committee we could not go to the river in the evening. But we had a wonderful time anyway./The senior assembly which was held June 22nd was a real success. I shall describe a few of the incidents that occurred. Our senior class president was given a blue, bably, bonnet to wear on his head. Then he had to drink milk right from a bably bottle with a nipple. They explained to him that since he is the youngest senior, age 15, they wanted him to act and be his age./Then another boy was called to the stage. This boy is always dressed very neatly and smartly. He was given a better set of clothes. He had to wear a shirt and pants made out of gunny-sack and parade around the assembly room./Then the student body president was called to the stage. He was asked which he liked better.--chocolate candy or a coke (coco-cola). He replied ""coke"" He happens to like a girl nicknamed ""coke""  So they brought out a bottle of coco-cola. (Everyone screamed with surprise and hunger at the sight of a bottle of coco-cola.) He had to get down on his knees and propose to the bottle of ""coke. He said ""Will you be mine?"" Then Ben Honda, a San Diegan, M.C. replied ""Yes, Coke will be yours"" and gave him the ""coke"". How we all envied him!!/This is just a few of the incident that occurred at the assembly. Of course, this was all in fun. No one but the committee members knew who was going to be called and what he is to do./The seniors won the baseball game by one run./Every Friday night is movie night. We always have to take our own chairs. But last Friday night we were provided with reserved benches. The movie was ""Hot Spot"" or ""You Wake Up Screaming"" starring Victure Mature and Carol Landis and Betty Grable./Then came Graduation Day. After graduation, a party was held in our honor. I was in charge of the refreshments. It certainly was a headache but I enjoyed it. Oh there were many delicious things to eat--cake alamo, punch, cookies, doughnuts = food galore!!!! All the mess halls were very generous./The party began about 10:30 P.M. and ended about 1:00 A.M. I went to bed 2:30 A.M. the next morning. I awoke 6:30 Sunday morning, ate my breakfast, took a little nap, ate my lunch, and went to put the finishing touches to the clean-up./When we arrived all the boys were sprawled all over the tables ""snoring"". Their friends gave them a poke here and there until finally they got up off the table, looked around with their half opened eyes, then rolled on the floor and off they went to dreamland again. After being sprinkled with water one by one they awoke and began to work. Oh how tired and sleepy everyone was!!!!/Well finally our group pictures arrived. It is not too good but I am enclosing one. I hope you like it./I'll put my pen aside so I'll be able to hear from you and I hope it will be real soon./Most respectfully,/Louise Ogawa","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, June 28, 1943","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>323-11-D/Poston, Arizona/Jan. 30, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/I have given up apologizing--you see--every time I write to you it is necessary to apologize for not having written sooner. So--no more apologies for a while!/On the 28th of January my brother left for Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Since then my mother and I find home lonely and missing something. If it wasn't for my pet radio I think I should go crazy with the unusual quiet. We will, of couse, in due time get used to the quiet and probably think nothing of it later. Perhaps in a few months we may move to Colorado to join my sister, but that is still vague. /Though many families are planning to join their fathers in internment camps, we probably will not be among them. The only reason for this is that I am unwilling to go. My mother will not go without me so there we are--right back where we started from. Other than being with my father I cannot see any advantage in going to an internment camp, therefore I am reluctant to go. The drawbacks are too many: once we go in we cannot get out until after the war, there would be much closer supervision of our lives, all our letters would be censored, and when we got out we would have absolutely nothing on which to fall back. The picture in my mind is to join my sister in Colorado. Her husband is doing outside work. We could stay in the center until the time that he could set up house. Of course we are leaning quite a bit on them, but in times like these we cannot help that as my father is interned. When the war ends my father would be able to join us, and we would at least have something to start us off anew. This problem has been bothering me for quite a while, but I feel that I am right in not wanting to go, though my father may not like the decision too well./I forgot to mention that my brother was granted permission to see my father in Louisiana while en route to school. He is taking a round-about way to school. He probably arrived there today and has seen my father by now. A great deal of what my brother writes and lets us know will sway our decision whether to go or stay in a relocation center. /My goodness, I forgot to thank you got sending the book ""The Disappearance of Kit Shane."" It was quite different from those you sent me before and I enjoyed solving the mystery with the author. I have meant to ask you whether I should return these books to you after my friends have finished reading them or not. You send me so many books that I feel that it is costing you lots of money and that they should be returned. Please let me know. If not, I will be more than happy to donate them to the library for you./How is the library now? Is it as busy as ever? The influx of population must keep you twice as busy these days. How is your mother now? I hope she is feeling much better now. /Other than working everyday I do not do very much. Over the week ends we go to see various basketball games. We have a movie every Friday night providing it does not rain. We still go to shows in the open air which is now rather chilly. The stars seem very near and every once in a while we see a falling star which is breathtaking. Moving airplanes often look like falling stars, but we can hear them as well as see them./In the daytime they often swoop down very low and try to scare us. They don't scare us anymore--just get on our nerves. Now a ruling has been issued that if the swoop down on us less than 200' we should take down the number and report it to the officials. This has helped us quite a bit but there are still some pranksters, but we don't bother with them anymore. I guess we would do the same if we were the pilots and wanted some fun. An airplane was an oddity in Santa Anita but it feels like home (S.D.!) over here./During the week it rained quite a bit. I certainly enjoyed the rain but I really hated the slushy mud.

It is very cozy and I like it better. / <br>I am very sorry to hear that transportation is so slow now. But at least you have some means of travel (not feet) but out here we don't have so much as a mule! (Though we have a few horses and cows.) The horses belong to the Indians and cows wouldn't be very much help. / At our school we don't have very much plays, except for a few speciel occaisens. Fore instance at Chirstmas each person holds a card with a letter on it. When each person is in the right place it it supposed to spell ""Merry Chirstmas."" Besides that each person must learn a poem to represent his letter. Mine was the last ""a"" in Chirstm@s. The poem was: / Apples in the stockings toe / Don't care much for apples though. / At New Years it was the same thing. I was the last letter in ""Year."" The poem was: / Resolve that we will help our parents and olders without a jerk! / ""Jerk"" is supposed to rhyme with lurk.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>April 9, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/Yesterday marks my first year in camp. Time certainly flies!/As I sit listening to my history teacher, Miss Warvarovsky, talking about the problems of today, a tidal wave of memories came rushing before my eyes. That feeling of sorrow and the emptiness of my tummy comes back to me every time I think of how I left San Diego. I shall never forget how I spent that night of April 7th sleeping on the train. My sister and I stuck our heads out the window never peeling our eyes off the direction of our home. We filled our eyes with the sight of San Diego to the limit until my pupils gave in and I dozed off./Today marks my first full day of camp life. Oh, how busy we were--hurrying and scurrying about--making the beds, sweeping the asphalt floor, running back and forth getting scraps of wood. Oh my! What a busy day that was. When I awoke this morning one year ago, I looked up at the ceiling and a funny strange feeling came over me. I knew I was not at home and had a terrible yearning to go home. A little boy next door was crying asking his mother to take him home. That day I felt so lost I was as blue as the deep blue sea. But the sight of a friend certainly cheered me up even though it was just for the moment I saw her. Today that homesickness still is within me but that lost feeling has disappeared. I often wonder how I have changed in thought, actions, knowledge, and facial and physical features during the short memorable one year./April 10, 1943/This morning was a very disgusting day one year ago. When I saw that the legs of my bed had sunk into the asphalt, I began looking at mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers. They were all like that. Then I knew my weight had nothing to do with it. But it was such a disgust./Yes memories--through experiences and hardship we become wiser./Now Poston--it may seem strange to you when I say--it is like winter again. I just wrote you and said it was very hot. Well, it was until two days ago. Today the wind is blowing, and it rained yesterday. I guess by now, you believe me when I say Poston weather is unpredictable. For certain it is!!!/April third was the Sr. Prom. The Camp I Orchestra came to play for us. The leader of the band is still a young boy. He plays the trumpet as well as the drums. Back home, he use to be a pupil of Gene Krupa. (a well-known orchestra leader.) He, I mean the leader of the Camp I band, is very good. The dance was held in 305 mess hall. It was beautifully decorated with orchid and white crepe paper. The reception was grand. But was so hot I felt sorry for the boys (they wore ties)./By the way, are Kleenex frozen on the outside? It is no longer available here. I have always been wondering about laundry soap. Is it frozen too?/After a long letter, I always seem to ask favors. I am such a troublesome correspondant./I have tried and tried to purchase a radio tube but I seem to have no luck. I wrote to San Diego to the dealer I purchased the radio from, but he joined the army and no longer has his shop. Then I wrote to Sears and Montgomery but they do not carry that kind of tube. So as my last resort I am asking you. You are the most reliable source I have. I have been trying to purchase the tube ever since Dec. of last year. Every once in a while I turn on the radio and then remember one of my tube is dead. Will you purchase the following tube for me. The number is 12SA7 G. T. Also a box of Lux soap. I just can't seem to get along without it. I'd like a few cards of that scarce thing called bobbie pins and shower caps./I am enclosing $2.00 in money order./<br>Please pardon me for troubling you so. Please do not rush this./Most sincerely, /Louise Ogawa","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, April 9, 1943","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"Stretched and framed.  Image of an older woman hunched over holding a sinuous bright yellow cat while standing in profile on a purple mesa overlooking a river or lake.  She wears a green blouse, lavender scarf and navy blue skirt; her hair is red and her skin is a peachy gold.  A green mountain emerges from the blue water in background.  Overall, the land is orange fading to rose, and the sky is a clear lemon.  Small orange and yellow flowers and shrubs peek from various crevices in the mesa.<br>When first gazing at the painting, one can not help but notice the dazzling colors of the artist's palette.  Undiluted, the artist, uses ultramarine blue, crimson and yellow in the central figures of the woman and cat, immediately drawing the viewer's eyes.  The secondary colors of green, orange and violet also lead the viewer through the painting.  The style of the painting is synchromistic with an emphasis on using color harmony to capture form and mood.  The shapes of the painting (the mountain, mesa and woman's blouse) are biomorphic and rounded, undulating with a rhythm similar to the paintings of Thomas Hart Benton, a contemporary of the artist and Stanton MacDonald-Wright.  The painting is symbolic in the images it presents.  The huddled and tense woman has her hand on her face and appears to be pondering a decision or awaiting something fearful.  The cat stretches out his neck suspiciously.  The woman is looking down at a river indicating flow and constant change and motion.  The mountain or mesa top that the woman stands on is unyielding and unmoving - yang (passive) to the river's yin.  One interpretation may be that the woman has to forsake an area with which is stable and unchanging and forced to confront some type of change -- unknown and potentially dangerous.

"Stretched and framed.  Portrait of man in profile wearing a cowboy hat with Heart Mountain in the background.  Dressed in a red collared shirt and eyeglasses, he appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s.  His proper left profile is shown and his head is tilted slightly downward.  His appearance is rather bohemian, with a goatee and a scraggly mustache.  In the background Heart Mountain looms in the bottom left corner, above a meandering river and the sky is dark and cloudy.  The artist uses a palette of muted colors (pale coral, soft gold, icy aqua and warm peach) to bring a sense of color harmony to the canvas.  The figure is centrally placed in the canvas, and the diagonal thrust to his neck provides a more dynamic composition.  To accentuate details within the figure, the artist used fine contour lines, especially about the features (eyes, ears, nose, and lips) and the waves of the hair.  The style of painting is realistic with elements of Asian calligraphic brush strokes in the finer details.  Frame has light hint of green paint.  The painting is a study of a man lost in introspection.  Although the uniquely shaped mountain identifies the location as Heart Mountain, Wyoming, the man's thoughts appear to be far away.  By showing Heart Mountain in the background however, the artist appears to be contrasting the man reflecting on his previous life compared to the confines of the present.",Untitled,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.9_a.jpg,"H: 10 in, W: 8 in",73776e85f912
"Stretched and framed.  Image of atomic blast with flames, billowing smoke and the identifiable mushroom cloud.  The sky is dark and filled with smoke and ash.  In the background, the sea is a gloomy gray-green.  In the foreground, a man stands upon a ledge observing the nuclear explosion.  He is nude, except for a red woolen cap and he carries a large sack over his shoulders.  His body is turned to the proper right and he is hunched over with the weight of his burden.  Near the base of the explosion, small figures are hurled away with the force of the blast.  <br>The central focus of the painting, the atom bomb, is placed vertically in the middle of the picture.  The flames at the base of the explosion radiate diagonally outwards, lending a sense of dynamism.  The red and orange of the flames (the brightest colors on the canvas) are repeated in the red glow in the center of the smoke column, and the red of the man's hat.  The strategic triangular placement of these reds help to lead the viewer through the painting.  The sky and clouds are painted in somber shades of bare white, gray and dull green in loose brush strokes.  The thrust of the flames are emphasized through the scratches made by the artist within the paint.  The style of the painting is naturalistic surrealism -- a 20th century movement in art in which recognizable scenes are transformed into a dream or nightmare image.  Frame is painted dark, muted olive green.  The painting is an anti-war comment noting the destructive force of the atom bomb.  The white mushroom cloud is painted bare-white and the dark concavities and depressions of the cloud are reminiscent of the hollows in a skull, symbolizing death.  The man in the foreground is carrying a burden and ramifications over his shoulder.  This may be representative of the burden of unleashing such a terrible technology.  His nakedness may symbolize his essential primitiveness and helplessness in unleashing this force beyond his control.  In the blackish smoke column on the viewer's right hand side, what appears to be a man's proper right profile emerges from the darkness.  This profile is very similar to the assumed self portrait of the artist (2003.159.9) with his goatee and cowboy hat.  If so, it may be that the artist is putting himself in the center of the devastation to show his anguish.",Atom Bomb,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.16_a.jpg,"H: 24 in, W: 18 in,  Frame: 31 x 25 in",950057e40c50
"Stretched and unframed.  Image of a nude man holding a flaming tree slung over his proper left shoulder as he runs on top of clouds in the night sky.  The tree (possibly a pine) is alight with red flames which consume its branches.  The scene is illuminated by the light of a crescent moon.  Dark clouds roll in the sky which is painted a watery blue-green.  The central figure of the painting, the nude man, is placed diagonally in the foreground of the canvas, giving the painting a sense of dynamism.  He is powerfully built, and his muscles are rendered with short, round brush strokes.  The sky and clouds are also painted loosely, with the curves of the brush strokes lending a rhythmic flow to the undulations of the clouds.  The stylization of the clouds are reminiscent of the clouds depicted in Japanese woodblock prints.  The colors are muted primaries -- coral red tree, brownish yellow skin, aqua blue sky and pale gold moon.  These colors effectively lend the painting a feeling of otherworldliness since it denotes a time neither day of night but of a perpetual dusk.  The style is naturalistic surrealism -- a 20th century art movement in which recognizable scenes are transformed into a dream or nightmare image.  The painting is identified as a ""comment on war"".  The man is naked, stripped down to his bare essence.  He is running blindly, with his head tossed back and his eyes closed.  He steps off a cloud into the unknown.  It appears that the tree he grasps is a pine which in Asian iconography represents longevity of life.  But flames eat away at the tree.  In Japan, the pine (matsu) is a symbol of strength challenged by a lifetime of struggle.  The ravages of war can destroy even the long-living pine tree.  The moon in Japanese culture symbolizes truth, based on the fact that it always remains in the sky, though ever waxing and waning.  In Buddhist tradition, it represents enlightenment.  In both readings, the moon reinforces the artist's desire to enlighten the viewer about the truth of war.  The artist effectively and symbolically comments on the blindness in which men go into war, full of ideology without understanding the consequences and the terrible carnage and war of war, destroying life.",Untitled,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.7_a.jpg,"H: 16 in, W: 12 in",2213ebf63550
"Stretched and framed .  Image of a nude man sitting upon an open-roofed structure, bent over in grief, next to a black bird.  The structure is cement colored and blackish, with walls and doors giving it a maze-like appearance.  In the background, a purple mountain looms above the horizon and the sun (or full moon) is obscured by dark clouds.  The painting is rendered in earth tones--muted hues of gray, putty, taupe and maize.  The sky is a shade of pale sea green.  The figure of the man is softly modeled and his proportions are exaggerated to emphasize his muscles and broad shoulders.  He is centrally placed in the foreground, and his bulk dominates the bottom the canvas.  The shape of the blackbird is simplified and solid.  The form of the building structure, painted diagonally lends a quality of dynamism into the scene.  Barely perceptible by the wall of the building and painted the same shade of earth as the ground is a shadowy ghostlike face or the suggestion of a skull.  The eerie light (whether it's from the sun or moon) provides an atmosphere of mysteriousness and foreboding.  The painting is styled in a surreal manner, creating an alternate world with highly symbolic imagery and meaning.  The frame is painted khaki.  While it is not obvious whether the artist painted this during or post World War II, it is apparent that it depicts a Japanese-American concentration camp.  The tilted plateau mesa of Heart Mountain (where the artist and his family were imprisoned) figures predominantly in the background.  The fact that sun (or moon) is obscured by dark clouds is symbolic of both the psychological darkness experienced by the artist at being locked away because of his race, and the darkness of the times, in which paranoia and xenophobia dominated the American psyche.  The male figure is holding what appears to be an eyeball, which may be symbolic of the government's desire to keep the Japanese Americans ""in the dark"" about the social injustice of their imprisonment. The building structure, representing the barracks at Heart Mountain, is reminiscent of a maze or labyrinth, emphasizing the sense of entrapment.  Two figures are the focal point of the painting:  the naked man and the blackbird.  Stripped of his clothes, his self respect, and his dignity, the man unashamedly weeps.  The blackbird is an ambiguous symbol.  In the Japanese tradition, the bird represents a messenger of the gods.  In the Western tradition, notably in Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven, the blackbird is a symbol of foreboding and ominous tidings.  The sense of doom is reinforced by the ghostly skull.  Overall, the painting is emotionally powerful.  Through symbolic imagery, the artist strongly depicts a shameful chapter in American history.",Untitled,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.6_a.jpg,"H: 13 in, W: 10 in,  Frame: 17 x 15.5 in",b855d05062d7
"Stretched and framed.  Unvarnished image  of a mother figure who holds in her proper right hand what appears to be a yellow flower that is being grasped by a smaller figure who is falling in mid-air.  The woman wears a gray robe belted with a lime green sash; her hair is greenish; her eyes are red and three-quarters view of the proper left side of her face is depicted.  She stands barefoot upon a floating lotus blossom, drifting on the sea towards the shore; her proper left hand raised with palm facing outward.  Dressed in crimson top and green pants and shoes, the smaller figure falls head first, with his arms and legs extended upwards.  His skin is a blue-gray color and his hair is the same gray as the woman's robe.  His face is shown in a three-quarter view of his proper right profile.  The artist uses a combination of muted and bright complementary colors to bring a sense of color harmony to the canvas.  The bright and muted colors balance each other and visually direct the viewer's eyes to the areas of primary importance.  The figures are placed centrally in the canvas.  The viewer's eyes are directed throughout the canvas by following the diagonal thrust of the child's figure to the vertical green sash, up the diagonal placement of the woman's hand and arm, leading to her neck and head, leading to her neck and head, back to the yellow flower and then back to the child.  The woman is standing upon a floating flower in the ocean and sea foam waves are depicted in stylized contour lines.  The painting is reminiscent of Sandro Botticelli's ""Venus"" (both figures are standing upon the ocean and drifting to shore admist the rippling of the waves and sea foam).  The child and woman are softly modeled with loose brush strokes, and the details of their hair and hands are rendered with delicate linear strokes.  The style of the painting is synchromism with its emphasis on a balance of form, rhythm and color harmony.  The painting shows the woman as a figure of dignity and strength.  She is painted in calm and muted colors and her figure is towering.  The child, on the other hand, is falling head first -- a precarious and vulnerable position.  One interpretation of the painting may be the archetype of the mother versus figure symbolizing maternal strength to keep the child from falling into a figurative sea of moral confusion. The painting could also be a metaphor for the wartime experiences of the Japanese Americans.   According to Buddhist tradition, the lotus flower is symbolic of enlightenment, supreme truth and purity emerging from impurity (it blooms unscathed from its muddy origin).  This reading substantiates the view of the artist's mother as a blessed, even reverential archetype of motherhood.",Untitled,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.8_a.jpg,"H: 24 in, W: 18 in",e717aadad0b3
"Stretched and unframed.  Image of a mother and child running away from flames and smoke.  Their entire bodies are depicted.  The woman is wearing a dark gray dress with an apron and the dress is torn away at her proper left shoulder, exposing her left breast.  The daughter is wearing a bright green pinafore with a white undershirt.  Both the mother and daughter have long streaming hair.  The mother's hair is light brown and her daughter's is golden.  They are fleeing flames depicted in the near background.  The mother and daughter are positioned slightly left of the center of the canvas and are balanced by the flames on the right side of the canvas.  The painting is comprised of a combination of muted and bright colors.  The smoke-filled sky is gray, lilac, soft blue and tan, and the mother's dress is a darker shade of the gray of the sky.  The vivid colors are in the flames -- salmon, pink, orange and yellow.  Also brightly colored is the emerald green of the daughter's dress and woman's shoes.  Because the background is so muted, a startling contrast to the bright and warm flames.  The brush strokes are loose and painterly.  Although the artist shows modeling in the clothing and limbs, he does not apply any fine details to the facial features.  Through the mother's and daughter's faces are painted loosely, their facial expressions are rendered clearly enough to register terror.  The dynamic quality of this painting is also reflected in the diagonal thrust of the characters leaning toward the left, counterbalanced by the flames which sway to the right.  The mother's and daughter's hair fanning out behind their shoulders are paralleled by the flames, fanning out behind them.  The painting shows the primal fear of a mother and daughter fleeing fire.  It is obvious from details such as the woman's disheveled state and the daughter's barefootedness that they only had enough time to save themselves.  It is unknown exactly when and why the artist chose to paint this particular image.  It may reflect an actual event, a comment on war, a reaction to the politics of the era or the artist's state of mind.  In any case, it dramatically shows a very human response reacting to known (and unknown) terrors.  The subject and composition is similar to Picasso's lighthearted ""Deux Femmes Courant Sur La Plage"" (Two Women Running on the Beach), but the mood envoked by Okubo's painting is dark and frightening.",Untitled,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/janm_2003.159.5_a.jpg,"H: 16 in, W: 20 in",bcfd338f0e35

It was the largest city between Los Angeles and Reno. It was a city serving a War time purpose where people lived in peace and good will, where schools were of as high a rank as other California schools, and where students dedicated their future lives to the American way of living. I hope you may say that that [sic] Manzanar was an experience worth living, where the important realities of life were made clear and where there was time and opportunity to prepare for participation in the work of winning the peace based on tolerance, understanding and good will.

Transcription:<br>Avenue 7, Barrack 1-C, Unit 20/Santa Anita Assembly Center/Santa Anita, California/April 13, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Here is the letter I promised you. Little did I think that I would see Santa Anita, where once trod the millions of pleasure seeking fans of the sport of kings--horse-racing. Why I'm actually treading the ground where the mighty Seabiscuit won his great duels on the track./ I am in good health and my arm is getting along fine. I received a doctor's order so I am allowed to have milk with my meals. The food here is about the same as the food at the county hospital with the exception of less meat here. Now that we have a number of San Diego men working in the kitchens the food has improved quite a bit, especially with the salads. I have heard that we are to receive meat soon, but I think that it will be mostly stew because we are not allowed knives, just a spoon and fork as eating utensils./The staterooms that we live in are not bad since the roof didn't leak at all during the rains that we had--which reminds me that we certainly lucky that it didn't rain while we were being assigned to our quarters. I think I have the autograph of blue Sun on our walls. I thought it was Seabiscuit's but my friend who lives near the center of town claims that his wall has Seabiscuit's signature. You see I live in the bachelor quarters on the edge of town. I am with four fellows from S.F. who are former members of the merchant marine engine gang of the Matson Lines. Two of them are all right but the others and I don't seem to get along. I am awaiting permission to move to another unit with a group of S.D. fellows/I finally received my messenger's job. The way it requires ""pull"" is terrific. If one does not have friends or is not able to bluff, he just about doesn't receive a job. Things are changing however because results are not in proportion to the amount of labor hired. Ability will count more and more from now on./April 14, 1942/I am writing this letter in sections during my spare time as you can see by the above dateline. Yesterday (the previous page) I mentioned that ability was going to count more and more. How true today, for last night the head man of the personnel dept. gave orders that no more people are to be hired by dept. heads; that all requisitions for workers are to be filled by Mr. Horn, personnel dept. Head. /I really like this messenger's work as that was what I wanted. Yesterday I covered the whole section in which living quarters have been established. Pretty close to 80 barracks. What a walk!!!!/I am getting to like this place very much. the view is wonderful with the mountains (I don't know the names yet) practically in our back yard. Santa Anita must have been truly beautiful when it was in session, since it looks beautiful now./The children of the younger age groups are now being organized by the Recreation Department. The schools aren't set up as yet, but the Recreation Department is going to do what they can for the young children in the way of education. /April 15, 1942/Please send me my barber equipment. I think they are packed in the small boxes. One has a York Co. label, the second one I believe has Sandwich Spread written across it, and the other I cannot recall (it is 4"" x 6"" x 8"" about the size of the York Co. box) I would also like to have my blanket roll as it contains barber towels./The address is: /Tetsuzo Hirasaki/Ave 7 Barrack 1C Unit 20/Santa Anita Assembly Center/Santa Anita, California/Well I can't seem to think of anything else to write so until the next time I'll say so long with the best wishes to you and your mother./Sincerely/Ted/P.S.

And oh, how useful they are!/Since we don't have a sewing machine, sewing by hand has become very common. Almost everyone is sewing a dress, skirt, or blouse by hand. After receiving the material, I began right away and wore it for the first time today. Everyone loves the material--almost as much as I do./I imagine you had many difficulties in buying the shorts. They were just what my brother wanted. Thank you!!!/I was very interested in the food prices. We were very surprised to hear celeries were 35-40 c. a head. It certainly made me realize how lucky we are to be able to eat plenty of celery. Yes, the recreation (Aug. 5: this letter may be delayed because post off. has not been open for a few days. Reasons can't be revealed under certain circumstances.) schools are still open. It is one of the successful projects. I imagine our stay here is soon coming to a close for our deadline to leave is Oct. 1, 1942./I am again going to take advantage of your kindness and excellent taste.

The camp has been divided into various districts from one to seven in order to facilitate the housing and feeding of all the evacuees. Each district has a mess hall which is identified by a shade of color. Each mess hall has a seating capacity of approximately fifteen hundred. Post offices, toilet facilities are distributed through the camp. There is one main Hospital in camp equipped with surgical &amp; medication to care for the sick. / For the sake of maintenance of mental pacificitym there are several very well organized departments. The recreational, education departments are the two largest and most active departments in camp. The primary purpose of both departments is to keep both adult + children occupied mentally or physically in some fashion. The recreational department have numerous baseball, softball, wrestling, weight lifting leagues + contests; clubs of all sort including boy + girl scoutings, sewing, knitting classes and even dancing + art classes. In the education department, with what facilities they have, there is organized school for adult and children from the first to the seventh grade. The school is on a pure voluntary basis, that is on the part of the students. There is a library made of books accummulated by various clubs. Books have been donated by various libraries and individuals from the outside. / Although the camp may seem complete in various ways, there are many disadvantages as you can readily see. Discontent with present conditions has been the root for many disorders lately. The ""kicks"" so called have been directed at the administration not as individuals but for the general policy enforced by them. / Today, the spark lighted the fuse which exploded into a fury of violence. For the first time the camp actually experienced mob violence. This outbreak are started by the searching of each unit by armed men of all personal belongings with utter disrespect for individual involved. Uncouth treatment of individuals plus theft by those making the investigation created a frenzy in camp. Huge mob of infuriated people gathered to ask for the reason of such doings. Frightened by the large crowd and excited by pointed questions directed to him, the investigator drew his gun and threatened to shoot anyone who might molest him. This threat lit the fuse which angered the crowd to the extent that flying fists were not in the least uncommon. The investigator was not hurt physically however I do believe that there was some change of attitude of this gentleman. Another man was hurt from this outbreak. There has been a drastic shack-up in the administration. / I hope you will not enter this letter into any round-robin letter. I should like this letter be written to your personally. This letter is extremely long + boring. I hope you will say hello to your precious sister.

"1 letter and envelope from Eleanor Breed to Clara Breed and Mother, Mrs. R.L. Breed + Robert Gordon family photo Christmas card and newspaper photo of Gordon family.  Transcription:<br>Berkely - 1/2/42 / Dearest Family, / New Year's Eve, about 7 p.m. when I was thinking of getting ready for the party at Dick's, the phone rang and a voice said, ""Eleanor? Do you know who this is?""  I didn't.  ""Well, it's Mrs. Robert Gordon of Honolulu!""  And I was surprised at the ring in my voice as I fairly shouted, ""Oh!!! Milly!""  I hadn't realized how glad I'd be to hear from her, for I'd persuaded myself she and the children were probably safe, all right.  We made a date immediately for the next morning, and I spent New Year's Day in the city with the Gordon refugees (see newspaper photo).  Almost the first words Milly said when she greeted me was, ""Oh, Eleanor, it's just wonderful to be alive!"" / Let's see if I can give a resume of all she said -- hard to do for a day's conversation.  About the attack (if you quote this, leave her name out -- might be better) -- as I imagined, they were at home on their ranch over across the Pali.  First they knew was the radio reports of planes bombing Pearl Harbor, which they couldn't believe any more than we could, getting them here.  The night before they had been at a party with the British Consul and his wife, and had discussed a possible Japanese attack, agreeing that it would come on a Sunday morning when everyone was sound asleep after spending his paycheck in the hot spots and officers were off week-ending -- so this particular Sunday morning seemed especially incredible.  They thought it was practice for a while, but the calls came through (some Japanese interference on the frequency even at the start) saying ""All nurses report here -- all physicians there -- all engineers somewhere else"" and finally they began to believe it.  No bombs fell on their side of the island, though they fell up Nuuanu and one on the Punahou campus, and a good many at Waikiki (aimed at Ft. De Russy) and of course most of all at Pearl Harbor.  ""It's much worse than we know,"" she insisted.  ""Four major battleships sunk in the harbor -- probably more like 4,000 casualties, for they're still toting up the number of lads that died trapped in their berths, without a chance to fight for their lives.  They got 200 airplanes in on hangar alone, others spread out on the ground.""  ""What about your airplane interceptors -- were they pointing due west to catch the Japanese coming from that direction, and the Japanese foxed them by coming in from the East?  That's been my xxx theory,"" I said.  ""They were shut down for the week-end,"" she said.  ""I don't know as to the authenticity of this, but the story goes,"" she went on, ""that a man out Diamond Head way was up early in the morning and caught sight of the planes through strong glasses, and ran to the phone to telephone the Commander at Pearl Harbor, but all he got was the reply, ""Japanese planes?  You're drunk.  Go back to bed!"" / She said that the American-born Japanese mayor of Waimea was found to have a short wa ve set on which he tapped out directions leading in the attacking planes -- and he was shot.  The organization for relief in Honolulu went through in fine, efficient fashion, everyone responding quickly and working wherever help was needed.  However, there was still stupidity and waste -- two huge trucks loaded with soldiers dashed too fast around the curves of the road to Diamond Head and crashed, killing a large number.  Guards were jittery and shot civilians. / ""What about some of our men who I hear were able to get their planes up off the ground in five minutes?"" I inquired.  ""There weren't but a few that could -- they hadn't any gas, and supplies were locked up.  So was ammunition, and no good going up unless you had something to shoot with."" / As to the trip back -- the Lurline, the Matsonia and a third former Matson liner came in, leaving Christmas Day.

"1 letter and envelope from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>322-14-D/Poston, Arizona/May 26, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Received your letter this afternoon. I wasn't able to see Fusa today so I'll try to see her tomorrow. We have had quite a bit of excitement with all my friends going outside into the world again. The excitement will continue as more and more leave almost daily at times. This evening said goodbye to seven people from our block. Yesterday two left. The day before, four. The day before that, two more. Come Monday about 14 will leave.--All  from our block. About half of them are on seasonal leave, the others are out for an indefinite period (almost the same as permanent leave) There are almost as many leaving from other blocks so you see there soon won't be very many people left in camp. The good part of it is that those who have ambition and the courage to brave the uncertainty of outside life are the ones going out. Only the culls are going to be left in camp. Of course there are going to be quite a few people who can't afford to go out because of lack of finances. Then too there are many young people who are held back by parental objections or obligations (by obligations I mean that the condition of one parent is such that they cannot move so the youngster has to stay home to look after the family) (over)/I am sorry to report that many have begun to like this camp life so easy-going with hardly and worries aside from what other way time can be more leisurely spent. I think that it harms the youths more than anyone else. The old folks have lived their lives. The young married folks still have their hopes. But it's the high school age group and also the early twenties that are becoming lazy and ambitionless other than to play all day. Live on the government is their creed--after all ole' Uncle Sammy will take care of them so why worry about the future. They are pretty disillusioned and cynical. However there is hope because now with all the young fellows going out many are becoming conscious of the outside. You know how it is--let some leader of a group of young fellows do something and the others soon follow. All in all with the sympathetic help of the WRA I believe that relocation will be on the successful side at least here in Poston. I haven't kept myself well posted on the number of people or the destination of all of them but the meager information that has come to my attention seems to indicate that Chicago Denver, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, and St. Louis are the ""big towns."" that are attracting the most. Many are out on seasonal leave out there in southern Idaho, northern Utah and far eastern Oregon/What a difference time makes. The cry was ""Go West"" (young man) now it is ""Go East"" (young nisei) The outlook for a family to relocate outside is not very encouraging. Many families came into camp with only two to three suitcases per member. They had sold their furnishings for the home. Furnished houses are very rare or are too expensive. As a result if the family goes out, they must start all over to furnish a house on an income that has not increased but decreased during the past year. Another thing many things that were sold are now not available or else priced much higher. This problem alone keeps many in camp. Couple that problem with the uncertainty of the attitude of the people, jobs to support a family (majority of jobs open now are menial.) and then you have the bottleneck to relocation. So at present those who can afford the expense, and those who are single (Bachelors - son - daughter) or are a married couple are the ones who are relocating./Nothing definite regarding relocation of either my sister or me.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>323-11-D/Poston, Arizona/November 23, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Gee, I really don't know how to start this letter as I have no good excuse for not having written to you sooner. My conscience has been bothering me in this regard so if I don't write and get this letter out soon I'll be having nightmares./I would like to thank you for sending me the cross-word puzzles and also for the dictionary. You really have me in a spot cause I want to let you know that really appreciate them but yet I haven't any really good excuse for not having written sooner./I guess you have been hearing over the radio about the riot in Camp 1. The version I heard over the radio was quite unlike anything that I have heard in camp. The radio news stated that Mr. Wade Head, head of these camps stated that ""'pro-Axis' elements, a small but well organized group, incited the people to go on strike"" or something similar to that. Gee, I was amazed at this report as it was the first of this sort that I had heard. All I know is hearsay, but it comes from reliable sorces so I'll tell you our version. The first outbreak occurred about two weeks ago on a Saturday night. A band of people were so sick and tired of ""Stool-pigeons"" going around and listening to private conversations and getting people into trouble that they went to the homes of the ""Stools"" and brutally attacked them. Then, two men were picked up on charges of ""Attacking with Intent to Murder."" 2 They were going to be taken to Phoenix by the FBI for a hearing. The people in Camp 1 heard this and balked. They did not want these men to be taken to Phoenix and tried for two reasons: first, they did not believe these men were guilty of the charges against them; second, if taken to Phoenix they probably would not get a fair trial. The people built large bon fires near the police station and parked all night to be on guard so that the men would not be taken out when everyone was asleep. To date one man has been ""unconditionally released."" The other has not been released yet. A proposition has been set up to the people in which this man may be given a trial here, but the people still want him unconditionally released, too. The terrible part of having a trial here is that anyone who goes up on the stand against this man is in for a tough time, and yet the people are unwilling to let this man go to Phoenix cause they think that the jury would be biased before the trial. That is all I know about it. So far the suspense is getting me. Some people wanted us to have a sympathy strike but most people see that it would only hinder us, so they have given it up. You know, the people who spy on their own people may profit momentarily, (is there such a word?) but in the long run they are asking for trouble and they know it before they start. Gee, but when situations like this arise we know that they asked for it, yet when crowds get violently mad it really is terrible. I hate to think about such terrible things going on in these camps but outbreaks like this are bound to happen. One thing which does not show but is an emense thing, is the fact that the people have given out some of their pent emotions and feel much more relieved after such outbreaks./I really don't know what my philosophy is, but I'm trying awfully hard to keep it balanced in these times. Gee, one day I think one way, then the next some other way, but I try to keep my balance. /The weather  has cooled down quite a bit and is rather pleasant except for occasional dust storms. We seem to be getting used to it, but still mumble./The latest rage here is artificial flower making. Most of the flowers are made out of crepe paper or orange and apple paper. My mother has made some crysanthemums, gardinias, iris, sweetpeas, cherry blossoms, lilacs, and carnations. I have made some carnations, but find the work too tedious. I guess I'm lazy but I would prefer to make other things./You know, I h","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Poston, Arizona, November 23, 1942","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>April 22, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/I received your swell letter yesterday morning, but was so busy that I did not get around to reading it until just now (11:00 AM.) I also received the box of barber equipment so that is now complete. It was better that you mailed them in installments, for if you had mailed them all at once I would have had a deuce of a time trying to carry them all. Besides it would have made many of the other people feel bad seeing one fellow getting so much at one time./The postal setup here is getting better now. At first they had the Japanese boys who had had postal experience prior to coming here to Santa Anita working under supervision of a postmaster from Arcadia. They did very well, and things were going smoothly. Then they decided to bring in postal employees from Arcadia to work in the Camp Santa Anita Postoffice. The Japanese boys were released, and boy did those poor Arcadia men take a beating!!! We did too. They did not know one Japanese name from another and we had to stand in line for hours before we could get our mail. Finally the postal authorities ""got wise"" and placed the Japanese boys back on the job. Now we have a Main post office near the administration buildings, handled by the Arcadia employees, and a branch located in the ""town"" that is handled by the Japanese boys. The branch handles just the letters. We have to go to the main post office for an parcel post./ On the question of sealed packages, if a person wants it to go as parcel post, he must write on the package that the package may be opened for postal inspection. Otherwise he must pay first class postage./At the present time I am a messenger during the day and barber at night. The mud here is not so bad, just in places it is gooey. I have just finished giving haircuts to the hospital staff. I am glad to report that the Dr. Tanaka, our San Diego doctor, was finally placed on the staff. Now that I am barbering my arm seems to be getting better all the time. I am glad you heard from my father. I have not received news from him as yet./ The menu here is very nice but--the food isn't prepared as well as could be expected. For breakfast we have coffee, buttered bread, jelly or jam, one egg, and prunes (sometimes we have 1/2 orange or grapefruit or 1/2 banana) For variety in stead of the egg we have a box of corn flakes or Wheat-o-nuts (bird-seed to us). For lunch we have tea, bread (unbuttered), stewed vegetables, canned fruit. Sometimes we have rice, with fish. Other times we have beans. On specialldays we have roast meat. For supper we have tea, bread (still unbuttered) beans, and a canned fruit. Of course, I almost forgot. We have sugar, salt, and pepper. The tea and coffee are such in name only. So you see the food situation can be improved greatly. I have spoken to the officials in charge and I am sure after talking with them that conditions will improve. The mess halls are cafeteria style if lining up for food is such. Everyone receives the same food. The mess hall that seats 5000 is the RED MESS HALL. It is in the main building where the pari-mutual windows are, under the grandstands./We are living in the stable buildings that have been converted into barracks. The Army style barracks are all located on the huge Santa Anita parking lot. They are only one story high. They are the same as those in Manzanar. We are using the race track and the grandstand area as recreation areas. We are getting up a softball league. Teams are being made up of the people from the various areas. San Diego and Chula Vista are represented. Some of the others are Long Beach, San Pedro, Gardena, San Francisco, Hawthorne, and a few others that I cannot think of at present. Fusa just came in and told me to tell you that she is not going to write to you until you answer her letter. She says that she is ""mad as blazes.""/I am kept rather busy messengering as I have to go from th","Letter to Clara Breed from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki, Arcadia, California, April 22, 1942","Hirasaki, Tetsuzo",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed + Camp I library report.  Transcription:<br>December 27, 1942/(Nice sunny day)/Time: 1:30 p.m./Dear Miss Breed,/Thank you ever so much for the lovely Christmas presents. The maroon suede jacket and belt are beautiful and fit me fine. Thanks very much for the ""Prince Matchabelli's Ave Maria"", the candy, nuts, and powder puff. I really appreciate your thoughtfulness and kindness./This time I am glad that I can be of some help to you, and hope that this letter reaches you before the deadline for your article in the Library Journal. I certainly would like to see your article if and when it is published./Here goes for some of the material you requested about Poston Libraries:/When I received your letter, I asked my brother, who was going down to the library in Camp 1 to go and get all the information that he possibly could. This is what he found./The library system in Poston has two distinct division: the Education Department, and the Poston Free Public Library./The library under the Education Dept. is under the supervision of Miss Ethel Manning, a former California State Library worker in Northern California (Colusa, I believe), whose central Poston school library is in Camp 2. She is being paid the regular W.R.A. salary. The W.R.A. supports only the Education Dept. Library. Miss Manning supervises the distribution of supplies such as books, collateral reading, periodicals, and miscellaneous incidentals./The Poston Free Public Library is classified as ""Community Activity under the jurisdiction of Dr. Powell. Miss Findley is head of the library division. Each camp has a separate school and public library; each functions as an independent unit with the policies, system, and regulations made by the Head Librarians and her co-workers./The Japanese Head Public Librarians are:<br>Camp 1. Mrs. Mabel Ota (of Holtville, Calif. a U.C.L.A. graduate--a very good friend of my sister)/Camp 2. Miss Yuriko Hasegawa/Camp 3. Miss Fumi Shiota/Since the W.R.A. does not aid the Public library all of the books received are gifts from various libraries in California; these are mostly old discards which are still legible, and also donation by people./It seems that both boys and girls prefer ""Western Stories."" Comic books were extremely popular, but due to the fact that too many children went to the library just to look at Comic books the librarian in Camp 1 has done away with them./They have a Hospital Service in Camp 1 and it seems that patients prefer mystery stories./A popular shelf in the library is ""Current Best Sellers."" They are rented out at 5 c. a week and are purchased by ""Petty Fines.""/Newspapers and magazines are donated by individuals who are subscribers. /The books are catalogued according to title, author, and their respective division such as fiction, non fiction, reference etc./I have enclosed some statistics gained from Camp 1 which my brother got. * /The information I got in Camp 3 is quite similar to that of Camp 1, though Camp 1 is much more advanced. /At the present time Camp 3 has about 3100 books. (least of all 3 public libraries) It receives mostly duplicates of Camp 1 and 2 and other books through donation. The membership at present is about 1500 with each person limited to 2 books or magazines for a period of 7 days. /Prior to opening, the librarian and her associates asked for donations. Some gave money, others books. With the money they bought new books. These books are rented out a 5 c. a week until they are paid for. Then, they are put into free circulation. Some of the latest books are: ""Storm,"" "" The Pied Piper,"" ""This Above All,"" ""Mary Cary,"" ""The Moon is Down,"" and ""The Sun is My Undoing.""<br>/Camp 3 has most of Children's Books while Camp 1 seems to be lacking them./Most popular among children is Fairy Tales and Comic Books (which they allowed to see--but not check out).

You made his Christmas a happy one and I am glad too. Maybe one of these days he will make an attempt to write you a letter. I am writing this letter to thank you for all you have done in the way of making Jack happy./In a camp like this there is not very much a child can do to enjoy himself. Jack has no games to play with so you can see how happy you have made him by sending him all those lovely books. We all thank you from the bottom of our hearts./Some of my girl friends like Louise, Margaret, etc. were talking about receiving presents from you too. They seemed very happy too. Louise was saying she has received quite a few books and she said she would lend me a book since I do not have any. I wonder if it would be too much to ask if I were to ask you to send me any old discarded book you might have at the library. I would appreciate it very much if you would do this for me and I would be grateful to you. The reason I ask this is because my Christmas this year was really awful. I didn't receive a single thing and I thought if you could send me an old discarded book of any kind I would have something to show as being a present from someone. I don't want to put you to any trouble and I do want you to know I appreciate all you have done for the many Japanese children.

And I was very glad to hear you like the little ""geta"". I'm sorry to say they were not made from a knot. Yes, the knot-carvers are very skilled people. I was very interested to read about your doll colllection and Fusa. I can imagine how Fusa stole the show. Miss Breed, I wish you told me about your doll collection when I was in San Diego and I would have been more than happy to add something to your collection. As I remember, you often had doll exhibits in the library--were they yours?/Thank you Miss Breed, for asking questions because it has helped me alot--for than I know this letter has something of interest to you. Now to answer them--yes, we do have chairs and tables. Father made them out of scraps of wood which we found here and there. They may not be of the best but they are substantial. We also have pillows which we brought from San Diego. But we do not have mattresses. We use some of our blankets as mattresses. In Santa Anita we were issued a spring bed and mattress but here we were just issued a cot. Many people who are skilled are making beds. They say a wooden bed is much better for your posture. The cot sinks down in the middle while the wooden bed stays straight./Miss Breed, it's a good thing you didn't see me eat my first meal with a knife. I would have been embarassed and you probably would have grown impatient waiting for me to finish that you would have told me to eat with my fingers. If Emily Post saw me than she would throw a fit./The movies are just grand. We see one every Saturday evening. It is shown outdoors. The screen is placed right in front of the oil tank and we sit (bring our own chairs) or stand and enjoy the movie. So far we have seen the following:/ 1) There Goes My Heart--Frederick March + Virginia Bruce/2) The Last of the Mohicans--Randolph Scott, Binnie Barnes/3) Doomed to Die--Boris Karloff/4) Topper Takes a Trip--Roland Young + Constance Bennett/5)Abraham Lincoln--Walter Houston + Una Merkel/The water and electricity is turned off on Sundays when the men work on the water pipe or while making canals etc. It has not been turned off for a long time now. The first Sunday we were here it was turned off. I'm glad it is not turned off regularly because oh, how inconvenient it would be!/The police and the post office and fire dept. is run by Japanese Americans. As yet I have not seen any persons connected with the army. There are no fence around this camp has there was in Santa Anita./School has not begun yet and I do not know who the teachers are. But I shall write more fully about it after school begins. Yesterday we saw how a teacher's room is going to be furnished. There was a nice bed was a spring and mattress, nice Spanish style bedroom set, a soft chair, lamp and linoleum on the floor. I was almost tempted to sit on the soft chair, sit before the large dresser and lay on the bed./You may have read about the boys leaving Poston to work in Idaho and Nebraska on the farm. About 45 San Diegans went. We expect them back in a couple of months. But while there, if they find a job they can call their family and stay there. Kunio Kawamoto (twin's brother), Sammy Shimamoto, Walter Obayashi, George Watanabe (June's brother) were among the ones who left for Idaho A few more boys left for Nebraska too./Here's something quite interesting which I read in a very recent edition of the Pacemaker--One man who lived in Santa Anita forgot and left all the money he had, $218.00 in a money belt under his mattress and left for Heart Mt., Wyoming. One of the working men found the money while picking up beds and mattresses. Then several days later the loser wrote back for the money and requested that 10% of it be given to the man who found it.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>April 25, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Thanks a million for everything: the nice letter you sent me, the pictures, and the book. I certainly was glad to receive all of them./I gave Mrs. Araki the picture and she was very grateful. She said that she was going to send that picture to her husband, who has been interned. She would certainly appreciate it if you would send another copy for her to keep. She said to tell you thanks a lot!/My mother gave the other pictures to Yuriko and Mariko. I believe that they will write or have written to you already. Thank you for sending me ""Judy Grant, Editor."" At the present time I am about half way through the book. I promised to lend it to another girl who wants to read it. I will pass it around, and as soon as they are through I will return it to you./Let me describe Santa Anita to you. It is located on a huge tract of land covering I guess about 75 to 100 acres. There are just rows and rows of houses. Families usually live in two rooms. If there are six or more in a family, they get four rooms. At the present time all the families live in what were formerly horse's stables. They all have new doors and windows in the front of the houses and the floors have been covered with asphalt. A partition separates the various families. We can overhear out neighbor's conversations even though we don't want to. One thing different from the ordinary home is the large door on the inside. The huge door is cut in half and is similar to those that the Dutch people have. These were made so that horses could stick out their head./The mess hall is located where the grandstand used to be, and where all the bets were placed. It is a huge place and very well constructed. I believe that must be about the only thing that was really well constructed. We have very good food to eat. The quality of the cooked food is getting better, too. You've noticed that I said ""cooked food"" because the food itself is almost the best. For example today for lunch we had: roast beef and boiled potatoes with gravy, spinach, and cole slaw. However, there are two things that bother me:/1. We don't get a second helping.<br>2. If the noon meal is very good, supper is terrible!/Gee, but really, I'm thankful for getting food free and also housing./My sister will arrive in Santa Anita on the 30th or the first of next month.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>Santa Anita Assembly Center/Ave. F. Barrack 27 Unit 5/District 5/Arcadia, California/June 17, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Thank you very much for sending me the package so promptly. I was very glad to receive them. My mother has already made me the skirt from the red and white seersucker material. She is now making my blouse with our neighbor's foot peddle sewing machine. The trimming was not exactly what I wanted but I am using it. I really appreciate your going to all that trouble for me./In regards to the word ""galloon""--I happened to see the trimming classified as galloon in the Sears catalogue and took it for granted that that was what it was called. I remember recently reading about galloon as being a gold braid on some uniform in a short story so I guess the lady may have been right, too./Thanks also for sending me the crossword puzzles and the stamps. It's good to feel so close to home. Some of the puzzles are very hard while others I have almost completed./Yesterday the workers on the camouflage unit went on strike. This doesn't sound very good and if it gets out to the public will probably give a terrible slant on us here. However, let me tell you about the worker's side first. There has been much grumbling lately because from what we understand the paychecks for April 3 to 15 have been made and are waiting for one official's signature--and still the checks haven't come out. On top of that rumors got around that the camouflage workers weren't going to get paid at all. One fellow had an argument with the foreman and all the others joined in with their fellow worker and said that they refused to work. It happened that food here had been just terrible for the last two days so that too was another reason to stop work./The result of this strike was that everyone thought that the strikers were unwilling to work on a defense project. That was not the idea at all. They demanded better food and something definite about their pay./We now have better food. I guess it's worth it to stir up trouble once in a while despite the criticism it arouses. /June 19, 1942","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Arcadia, California, June 17-19, 1942","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

We had a very nice Chirstmas party on our block. A orchestra leader from camp 2 was our song leader. He sang very nicly. Everyone got a preasent. I got a paper doll set, notches, and a book. A girl gave me her paper doll set because she didn't want it./In the morning it is very cold. I hate to get up to go to school. Sometimes I wish it was vacation, but still I wouldn't want to go to school in the summer because it is so hot. We have a stove in our school room, but it doesn't warm us up. Not even the girl that's sitting in front of it can't feel it. We could have got a stove, but there isn't enough, so my mother said to give it to the people who really need it. We have a pail in our room, and we have some sand in it. we put hot charcol in the pail and we have a stove. We go to the ""park"" and burn wood, then we put it in water, and we have charcol./There's a lot of cows in our ""park."" I suppose you're wondering what our park is like, unless I already told you. If I haven't, I'll tell you now. Theres lot of trees growing, and there is a stream that goes all around the park. In the summer time the trees make a good shade. They cleared away some of the trees, to make charcol./Yesterday afternoon was rather hot so I went to the canteen to get ice cream, and what a surprise I had! They had Sherbert! It tasted very good, so today I went again to get some more but they were doing inventory. My mother washed the kitchen towels for two months, so this month she got 32 dollars for the two months. We didn't get our pay for a long time so when we finally got it, we bought a lot of things now we have only ten dollars left from the pay. I wanted so bad to get yarn to make my doll a pullover sweater, but my mother wouldn't let me. When I go home I'm going to get a lot of yarn and make a lot of things. /We're working harder then ever now at school.

After eating a piece of the candy, my father remarked - ""My, this candy is as sweet as you and Miss Breed!"" And oh, how true that is! Thank you again./It is very hot in Santa Anita. As Miss Breed has noticed we, Margaret, Fusa, Yaiko, and I, all are as black as we could be--maybe I should have just included myself because I certainly am black--BLACK. If I was standing next to you during a blackout, you wouldn't know whether I am there or not. I imagine San Diego is pretty hot but not too hot or am I mistaken?/I imagine you've heard from Miss Breed that she visited us. I was overwhelmed with joy to see her. I certainly missed seeing you but I know how busy you are. I hope one of these days I'll be able to surprise you and come walking merrily into the library and say--""Hello, Miss McNary, it's so nice to see you again!"" I am praying that that day shall come soon./Oh, the mess hall bell is ringing so I must be trotting along for my tummy is calling for food.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>August 27, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Greetings from far-off Poston, Arizona! We arrived yesterday about 3:30 P.M. It was a very long train ride--about 17 hrs. After leaving Barstow, we began to feel the heat. They say yesterday was a cool day but to us it was extremely hot./We traveled through desert after desert. There were many houses which looked as if they were built many years ago. We seldom saw a human being except when passing through a small town. One of the most beautiful scenery was when crossing a bridge which was right above the Colorado River. It is, indeed, a beautiful river./One common thing you see while coming here is--the beds and beddings are all placed outside the homes. It has been said that the heat is so hot that the people all sleep outside. It is very hot here. We traveled by bus through acres of cotton plants--so you can imagine the heat because cotton has to be grown in a hot climate./After leaving the train, we had to travel by bus--about 20 miles. We are in Camp No. 3. It is not quite yet completed. It is so sandy here that everyone's hair looks gray. Sometimes the wind blows but when it does the sand comes with it. This camp is so far away from civilization that it makes me feel as if I was an convict who is not allowed to see anyone. I'd much rather sleep in the Santa Anita horse stables--this has made me realize how fortunate I was to be able to live in Santa Anita. The nearest town which is a very tiny one is about 20 miles away. This trip has made me realize the wonderful work of nature. Her delicate work in shaping the stone mountains, the beautiful coloring of the surroundings--it seemed as if I was looking at the picture or a painting of a genius./This place differs greatly from that of Santa Anita. In Santa Anita we were allowed to keep a bucket and a broom in our homes until the time came to leave but in Poston we are allowed to BORROW a bucket, broom or mop for 1/2 hrs. This makes it very inconvenient because often they run out of them and we have to wait until one is returned. Even in the dining rooms we have to take our own spoons and forks. They provide just the knife and cups + plates and, of course, food. Yesterday I ate rice, weenies and cabbage with a knife. That was a new experience for me! You never realize how valuable a thing is until you experience it. The dining rooms are very small here because there is one to each block. There is about 16 barracks to one block. To each barrack there are 4 units. A laundry, lavatory, + shower are in each block. There is also an Recreation Hall to each block too. There is no post office here. There is one (just one) which is in Camp 1 (about 3 miles between each camp--so we have to walk 6 miles in order to go to the post office. We take our letters to the Block Manager and he inturn takes the letters by truck to Camp No. 1. That is how the mail is handled./The houses which we live in have a double roof. The regular roof and another one which is much larger on top of it. This is for the safety of the occupants in case of a dust storm./There is to be a movie Saturday night--and I am looking forward to it./Miss Breed, I lost one hour when the time changed to ""war time""--well, I lost another hour because in Arizona it is mountain time which is one hour ahead of Pacific War Time./We have to mop the house every day because of the dust but it does not do any good because before you know it it's dusty again./My, this letter is getting too long and it's probably getting boring so I'll write again soon. If you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer them if I am able./I hate to ask you this but mother insists so I picked up the courage and decided to ask. Mother would like to have a paddle-lock costing between 75 c.--$1.00. She would like 5 keys. Would you please send me a lock and if not enough keys please have them made so it'll total to 5? I am asking too much when I ask you t","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, August 27, 1942","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Everything I ordered came except a sweater. Florence was lacking a few things, but we are all sincerely thankful for what the Government has done for us. Little Thomas and Florence were each given an excellent pair of shoes, which Florence could hardly wait to try on./School is similar to San Diego. We are using the California method. Florence seems much happier here in school than San Diego because of her many Japanese classmates. I have an American teacher for Core Studies (History and English) and find her very nice. Incidentally Louise is also in three of my classes. At present we are studying the agriculture of Poston and the economic conditions of United States. I am taking  Bookkeeping and Shorthand both under Nisei teachers. They are mostly University students who have already graduated or were about to, and I think they make good teachers./I am typing this letter by Thomas who is dropping everything from his crib. He will not stay still for a moment. On the 27th he will be 9 months. He has his 6 teeth now and certainly is making good use of them./Today is the last day of a 3 day County Fair in Camp 1. Last night I went with some of my girl friends on a huge truck. There were mostly exhibits. I found much talent displayed at the Fair by different people from each of the 3 camps who made and drew many clever things. Miniture plans were skillfully made of a nursery, fish cannery, and poultry. They sold candy, pop corns, ice cream, hot dogs and hamburgers for eats. I was certainly glad to go to the Fair, because it was something different after so long. /Florence drew a picture of a dog at school which she would like you to have. She hopes you like it.

"Stretched and framed.  Oil painting of a gold skinned woman floating upside down, kissing the lips of the head a green haired man in three-quarter profile.   The man has a grayish lavender face with bright pink lips, orange-red pupils in yellow eyes and pink green hair; he has a scant moustache and goatee and wears a pumpkin orange shirt.  The woman is pale gold with black hair, gray eyes, coral lips and white pear earrings; she wears an orange shirt with a gray sash and a sea foam green skirt.  The man stares straight ahead, toward the right of viewer.  The woman's arms are outstretched in an embrace though the man appears to see past her. <br>The artist uses a combination of bright and muted colors to bring a sense of color harmony to the canvas.  The brightest colors (golden yellow, orange and green) make up the woman's body and the eyes and lips of the man.  This placement of color commands the viewer's attention and visually unifies the man and woman.  The painting is rendered in a gently modeled fashion, particularly about the shading of the face, the folds and drapes of the woman's clothing, and the soft glow of the skin.  The finer details are painted with delicate contour lines (the facial features and individual strands of her hair).  The style of the painting blends elements of naturalistic surrealism (a 20th century art movement in which recognizable scenes are transformed into dreamlike images), and sychromism (with an emphasis on color harmony, balance of form, and rhythmic line work).  In this painting, the artist provides the viewer with an intimate glimpse of the reverie of the young man.  He appears preoccupied as expressed by his wide and staring expression.  The woman exists not in a literal sense but figuratively in his thoughts.  The juxtaposition of the imagined woman and the real man shows the coexistence of a spiritual and physical realm.",The Kiss,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/janm_2003.159.53_a.jpg,"H: 10 in, W: 11 in",1668514d997c

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>Santa Anita Assembly Center/Barrack 31 Ave. S. Unit 3/District 6/Arcadia, California/Dear Miss Breed,/Thanks very much for the pictures. We just laughed and laughed and laughed over them. The funny smiles on our faces really had us in fits./The last two or three days has been terribly hot. According to our thermometers it's been in the 100 degrees. Golly, it certainly is tiring to have such a sudden heat wave. Right now it's rather on the chilly side. I read in the papers that San Diego had only a mild 79 degrees./You know, things here are changing all the time. In regards to your plans for coming here, I'll have to be a wet blanket again. An announcement came out that Districts 1, 2, and 3 may have visitors on Sunday this week, and the rest of the districts must have visitors on Saturday. Then next week it will be in reverse. Why don't you plan to come up on the 31st, a Sunday. The visiting hours are from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Since you mentioned the fact that you would like to come in the morning, maybe we could arrange to have it that way. Please let me know what you have decided to do. One thing is certain though, I can't meet you this Sunday./Another announcement just came out stating the fact that we cannot receive any perishable or non perishable food here. The only thing we can bring in from the outside is candy. Gee, that really makes me mad. On top of that, the Canteen has stopped selling cookies, sandwiches, cakes and all sorts of sweets except candy. We have all come to the conclusion that the mess halls will have to serve us better food. Gee, I like stew, but I don't like to eat it three meals in succession. Gee, I always get onto the subject of food-----well, don't blame me too much as it is about the only thing we think about./We've moved again. This makes the third time we've moved inside this camp. We're now in smaller rooms. We no longer live in the stables, but in regulation army barracks. The only difference is that these barracks originally had three large rooms, now they have been partitioned into six rooms: three large ones and three small ones. We live in one of the smaller ones since there are only three of us. The room is ideal for two, but is rather crowded with three. We have one large shower and one large laundry room. We certainly don't see how they expect over 16,000 people to be clean and also have their clothes clean. Many of the women get up about 5 a.m. and go to wash. If you try to go about 8 a.m. you're bound to have to wait a good hour or more. However, this is being quickly remedied for we can see three construction on their way up. They're (so we've been told) all for showers and laundry rooms. Anyhow we certainly hope so. The only thing they don't have here is a dry cleaners. I don't know how to get my things really clean. We use gasoline and also a wet cloth, but it just doesn't seem to be really clean. /The library here is progressing nicely. We've had many books donated from the nice San Diego people. We've had some from some of the State College teachers, and of course, some very nice books from you. A girl friend of mine told me that they had the whole office full of books to be filed and set up for public use. The head librarian is Anna Morikawa. I believe you may know her. She lived in Old Town, and I used to see her at the Children's Library once in a while. She is a very soft spoken person with the cutest dimple. I don't know if that helps any though./I see Tetsuzo once in a while now. I used to see him every day, but I was transferred to another district and and don't see him very often./I was thinking about your being on a sugar ration. At first I thought that we had it pretty soft because that was one thing we didn't have to wait in line for. About a week ago we had sugar for breakfast, but none for lunch or supper. Then, this morning we didn't even have any sugar for breakfast. The","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Arcadia, California, May 22, 1942","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Visible from the neck up, the woman is turned three-quarters view of the proper right side of her face and looks toward the right edge.  Young and attractivve, she wears a bright lime hair band with flowers tucked underneath and what appears to be a corsage on her lapel.<br>The artist uses a pallete of muted complementary colors, primarily reds (as coral and rose) and greens (as lime, sage and sea foam green).  The usage of these colors side by side serve to brighten their hues and give the painting a luminosity and brightness.  The bust of the woman is centrally placed in the canvas, and the image is cropped at the top of her head.  The shading is softly modeled, and the fine details of the woman's hair, brows, eyes, lips, nose and ears are rendered in precise and elegant contour lines.  The hair in particular has a grace and rhythmic quality in its fluid lines.  The style of the painting is influenced by synchronism and is similar to Hideo Date's portraits; both depict graceful and solid women using a balance of form, rhythm and color harmony to attract and excite the viewer.  The woman depicted is young, lovely and full of vitality.  The flowers in her hair and boom emphasize the freshness of youth.  The glow of light on her face seems to reflect an inner glow in her character.

"Stretched and unframed.  Portrait of a woman with green skin and blue hair, eyes and lips.  Head and shoulders are depicted.  Her hair hangs loosely around her shoulders.  The woman is depicted a three-quarters facial view of the proper left side of her face.  She wears a vivid burgandy dress, patterned with salmon pink, green and gold stylized patterns; a brooch of a scorpion is pinned on bosom and bold red earrings dangle from her ears.  The woman is positioned centrally within the canvas and her neck and head are titled diagonally.  The artist uses bold primary colors --blue, red and yellow--and their respective complements--orange, green and violet-- to bring a sense of dynamism to the painting.  The bright colors instantly attract the viewer.  Upon closer examination, the viewer can note how the face, neck, and shoulders are gently shaded to indicate bone structure and musculature.  The brush strokes are loose in these areas.  The finer details of the hair, eyes, nose and lips, however, are rendered in a more delicate style--with precise and tight brush strokes.  In particular, the hair has a rhythmic quality in its repeated linear brush strokes.  The green pattern on the woman's dress is reminiscent of formalized Japanese kimono pattern.  The style of the painting is similar to Hideo Date's paintings -- both have a basis in Stanton MacDonald-Wright's sychromism movement with its emphasis on color harmony, balance and rhythmic lines.  The woman depicted is beautiful, with a muscularity and solidness.  The artist seems to depict her character through her full yet firm curve of her lips, her flared nostrils and the arch of her eyebrows.  Her brush with the scorpion on it also seems indicative of her personality.  This is a study of a woman who is self-assured and confident, who faces the world with fearlessness and a little scorn.",Untitled,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.3_a.jpg,"H: 20 in, W: 14 in",53a6b8f74a74

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>District 1/Barrack 7 Unit 1 Ave. 7/Santa Anita Assemby Cen./Arcadia, California / April 30, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Oh! Miss Breed, I think I am the luckiest girl in this camp to have such a kind generous friend as you. I don't know how to begin to thank you for sending me another nice book. I thought Roxana Rampant and Betty Blake O.T. were such interesting books they have become one of my favorites. Margaret Ishino is reading Betty Blake O.T. now and I won't be surprised if I read it again after she is through./After hearing that the afternoon mail came in, I hurried to the post office. Yes, as usual the line was a block long and that meant I was at the end of the line and oh what a long wait that was. But my patience was rewarded. I was told that I had a package awaiting me. Then such thoughts as, maybe someone sent me something by mistake--could it be a cake or maybe a box of cookies or candies--oh--I know it couldn't be a book rushed through my head. But to my surprise it was a book. And I was so happy I felt like shouting. Thank you ever so much for the nice book! I wish I knew a better word than thank you to show my appreciation. THANK YOU, Miss Breed!/This afternoon I ate one of the nicest lunch. It was-hamburger, 2 slices of tomato, rice, and baked potato. It was delicious./For the past 2 days people from L.A. have been coming in. This place is gradually getting full./We have a library now but there are no books as yet just magazines. I imagine there will be books in the near future. At least I hope so. But I am certain no library will be able to replace the San Diego Library./There does not seem to be much news today so I'll close now. Thank you again Miss Breed!/Sincerely,/Louise Ogawa/Please give my best to Miss McNary","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Arcadia, California, April 30, 1942","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Helen McNary.  Transcription:<br>August 9, 1942 / Santa Anita Assembly Center / District 5 F-27-5 / Arcadia, California / Dear Miss McNary, / It was my intention to write to you on the same day I wrote to Miss Breed, but a mob riot developed and caused all suspension of work. / Before I tell you about it I want to thank you for sending me the candy and also for lending me your shorthand book. At the present time my shorthand is at a standstill, but as we may move soon, I hope to resume my lessons in the winter. / Though we don't know where we will be moving we expect to be snowbound in the winter. At any rate, it certainly will be much colder than San Diego. / On Wednesday, the army (not from Frisco, though) ordered our barracks searched for contraband. Previous to this whenever such an order was issued we were given bulletins and notified on everything. This, however, was done abruptly with no reason given and did not give the people a very good attitude toward the search. Then, they closed certain gates and would not allow the people to pass unless they were searched. This, too, aroused their anger. / Then, to top that, they began to confiscate such things as scissors and knitting needles as contraband. Then, some of the police had the nerve to steal people's money and also remove things from people's houses without allowing the occupant to see what was taken. One policeman in particular aroused the people to such a degree that they began to mob him. Incidentally a Korean was leading the men in their raid. Many people had grievances against him before as he was claimed to be a ""stool pidgeon"". Unfortunately the mob of people were so aroused that they chased him and beat him with chairs. This was wrong, but a mad mob is very hard to control. Incidentally this led to the discovery of liquor smuggling and jailing of some of the stewards of the mess hall. The army took control for three days and everything was at a standstill. We and also the army were glad they finally moved out. The newspapers did not give this version, but that's the way we saw it. Just a few days before the incident we were all craving for excitement, but now that it is over we are glad that it is over. / Once again thank you for the candy and book. If you have time, please write to me sometime. / Sincerely, / Fusa Tsumagari","Letter to Helen McNary from Fusa Tsumagari, Arcadia, California, August 9, 1942","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa written to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>November 30, 1942/<br>Dear Miss McNary,/Since I didn't do any house moving in Santa Anita, I'm doing double duty here. I've moved again. This time I hope it will be permanent. My new address is now: Blk. 328-11-A/After 6 weeks of school life in camp has become similar to the life in San Diego. We now have a school paper. At the present there is a contest going on in submitting names for the school. The winning title will receive a year's subscription to Life Magazine./Friday, Nov. 27th, I enjoyed the movie, How Green Was My Valley. With it I saw a news reel about the sailors in training in San Diego. When I saw Balboa park and the Naval Training Station, I became too homesick for words. All the former San Diegans began to clap and hurrah as soon as they saw a glimpse of our hometown./I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving, even though the world is in such a turmoil. We had a wonderful Thanksgiving. The mess hall was beautifully decorated with artificial flowers. On the sides of each table was a vase of flowers and in the center was a spray of fresh fruits on fresh green leaves. We had turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mince pie, peas, potatoes, fruit salad and a choice of fresh fruits. The whole block consisting of 350 people sat before the beautifully decorated table, gave their thanks and ate together--recalling the happy moments of the past and hoping for a brighter future. It was a wonderful meal!! I never expected to have such a nice Thanksgiving dinner this year. This year there certainly was more things to be thankful for--at least for me there is./The boys who went out to work on the sugar beets in Colorado came home just in time to enjoy the Thanksgiving dinner with their families. All the boys who went out to work--Idaho, Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming--are all back home now in good health. But there is still a few boys out working in Oregon. They transferred from Idaho to Oregon./A friend who returned from Colorado related the following incident to me. He said, while in town a few boys entered a restrauant to have a bite to eat. The first thing the waitress asked was ""Are you Japs?"" When they replied ""yes"" she turned her back on them and said they don't serve Japs. So they had to go to another restrauant to eat. Here is another incident which disgusted the boys. When the boys asked a policeman where a certain store was he replied--""I don't serve Japs."" One of the boys became angry and remarked--""Alright be that way--what do you think we came out here for? We didn't come to be made fun of--we came to help out in this labor shortage."" Then the policeman apologized and showed them to the store. This boy said he certainly was glad to return to camp where there is no unfriendliness. Of course, he knows and we all know that there are people all over the world who hate certain races and they just can't help it. But I am sure when this war is over there will be no ratical discrimination and we won't have to doubt for a minute the great principles of democracy./One discouraging thing which occurred here is the building of the fence. Now there is a fence all around this camp. I hope very soon this fence will be torn down./I always seem to rattle on and on about myself. Three pages is enough for me, I think. Pretty soon I will be writing an autobiography./I do hope you are just fine and I can just see you scurrying around the library without a moment of rest. How is everything? Please don't overwork yourself and please be careful of your health for these wintery days are so cold./Most sincerely,/Louise Ogawa/Please do write during your leisure time./<br>","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, November 30, 1942","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed + sample of picked cotton.  See 93.75.31JO regarding the cotton.  Transcription:<br>November 11, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Since the last time I wrote nothing exciting has occurred. We are all in the finest of health. I hope you will receive this letter in the best of health./Saturday, Nov. 7th I experienced something which I shall never forget. I went cotton picking with my fellow school-mates to raise funds so the school will be able to have a school paper./We left home at 8:30 A.M. on a cattle truck. We were going bumpity bump down the narrow dirt road when all of a sudden we came to a halt. We quickly jumped ot our feet and saw a little house with a military police sitting in it. Then we were counted like cattles and again were on our way. We went winding through the Mosquite trees until finally we were surrounded by cotton plants. Everyone cried out, ""Well, here we are--let's get busy!"" After piling out of the truck like ants, we were given a large sack in which to put the cotton. This sack was very very long. It weighed 2 lbs and often got in our way. We flung the bag over our left shoulder and began picking the cotton. I often crawled on the ground to pick the fallen cotton. It certainly was a good thing that I wore slacks and a long sleeve blouse because, you get scratched all over. I picked the long staple cotton./A.--long staple cotton--small cotton which is very hard to pick--4 c. a lb. in the price/B.--short staple cotton--large cotton which is much easier to pick for it is the larger cotton but the price is 1 c. a lb./It certainly is a boring work. It is no wonder that the negroes have developed such a talent in singing. But I enjoyed it tremendously. This is the way we looked:<br>[drawing]/Please use your imagination for it'll help a lot. This bag holds 150 lbs. or more cotton, the man said. I only picked 14 lbs. but I tried! I was disappointed./We stopped work about 4:30 P.M. and were taken to the trading post which is about 8 miles on this side of Parker. The trading post was one of thise country stores where they sold from shoes to food. There were many Indians there. That is where they do their shopping./One thing I missed was water.

"1 letter and envelope from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>322-14-D / Poston, Arizona / October 3, 1942 / Dear Miss Breed, / How are you? Thanks ever so much for the wonderful letter. (would you mind if I showed it to some friends?) I have just written a letter to Mrs. Lila McArthur asking her to bring you to Poston on her next trip. She has been here to see some of her friends. At Santa Anita she was a very frequent visitor. Which reminds me, people are allowed to come right into the camps here and mingle with the people. It is very rarely that we see a caucasian face. Now that the caucasian school teachers are here in camp we see a few more caucasian faces than before where two-four days even a whole week went by without sight of a caucasian face. The first impression of them (the teachers) is rather disappointing. Oklahomans -- Texans it seems as if the children will be all drawling ""Suthun' Style."" Several of the nisei teachers seemed pretty well disgusted with a few of them. However the ""proof of the pudding is in the eating"" and school starts Monday. I hope to meet some of them personally so that I can be more sure of what to think of them. / Life is beginning to settle down to the monotonous regularity that is truly depressing. People have gotten so that they don't leave their own block. Let alone leave their ""home."" (apt) Not much sociable visiting going on at all. The afternoons are still too hot to do so. And who wants to walk in dust up to the ankles. Canteens are not so crowded as they used to be 'cuz the people haven't the money they used to have. You see we have to buy what we used to get free from the W.C.C.A at S.A.A.C (Japanita) Brooms, buckets, baby food, fresh fruit, mattress, (spoons, forks, none in Mess Hall) Soap for Mess Hall (Dishwashing) / At the present time soap is being delivered to the mess halls since we fought for it. After all the dishes had to be washed clean. There's quite a bit of graft going on and I think we're going to get rid of that now that we ""agitators"" from S.A.A.C. are waking the people of Poston. / We're having quite a ""labor shortage"" here now that many of the able-bodied fellows are going out to relieve the beet sugar workers' shortage in Idaho, Colorado, Nebraska. It's certainly lonely here after the young fellows left. / Five or six years ago I met a young fellow in Los Angeles and became good friends. After the second meeting I didn't see him until a week ago Only to say hello and goodbye for he was outward bound to Colorado to go to work on a sugar beet farm. Such is the working of Fate. / <br>Well my time is growing short and I have to go to work again in the mess hall. I hope to have more ""inside dope"" soon. / Sincerely yours / Tetsuzo<br>","Letter to Clara Breed from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki, Poston, Arizona, October 3, 1942","Hirasaki, Tetsuzo",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

I enjoyed them very much./ I am sorry for not writing sooner, but we ran out of envelopes and they didn't have any at the canteen./ School has started ever since last Monday, so that is where I spend most of my time. We had been haveing a Japenese teacher until Friday. O Friday the princible brought a american teacher. So starting from monday, we have a new teacher. I have to walk 3 blocks to school. We have scholl in a long barrack. it is cut into 3 sections. (we are in the middle.) When we have singing we go into the next room, which is the 4th gr.  By the way, did I tell you I was in the 5th gr.? I had 2 slips. One said to go to the 6th gr. and the other one to go to the 5th gr. We sure do get hard work. Like Fri. we had to write our life history. We had to write the day we were born, the hospital What age we were when we moved from house to house, what age we were when we started school, what the name of the school was, a few other things, and last of all what we liked to do best. Our Japenese teacher wouldn't even let us study any words and she goes and gives us real hard words. Well I guess I'll learn some day. Thank you again./Yours Truly,/Katherine Tasaki/P.S./For the first time since I came here my mother put on curlers. But I'm afraid it won't turn out good because my is too long.

I've moved and my new address is: Blk. 328-11-A/After six weeks of school life in camp, everything has become similar to the life in San Diego. We now have a school paper. At the present there is a contest going on--submitting names for the school. The winning title will receive a year's subscription to Life Magazine./Friday, Nov. 27th, I enjoyed the movie, How Green Was My Valley. With it I saw a news reel about the sailors in training in San Diego. When I saw Balboa park and the Naval Training Station, I became too homesick for words. All the former San Diegans began to clap and cheer as soon as they saw a glimpse of our hometown./I hope you had a very nice Thanksgiving, even though the world is in such a turmoil. We had a wonderful Thanksgiving. The mess hall was beautifully decorated with artificial flowers. On the sides of each table was a vase of flowers and in the center was a spray of fresh fruits on fresh green leaves. We had turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mince pie, peas, potatoes, fruit salad, and a choice of fresh fruits. The whole block consisting of 350 people sat before the beautiful decorated table, gave their thanks and ate together--recalling the happy moments of the past and hoping for a brighter future. It was a wonderful meal!!! I never expected to have such a nice Thanksgiving dinner this year. But I certainly have much more to be thankful for./The boys who went out to work on the sugar beets in Colorado came home just in time to enjoy the Thanksgiving dinner with their families. All the boys who went out to work--Idaho, Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming--are all back home now in the best of health. But there is still a few boys out working in Oregon. They transferred from Idaho to Oregon./One discouraging thing which occurred here is the building of the fence. Now there is a fence all around this camp. I hope very soon this fence will be torn down./Is soap rationed in San Diego? I was just wondering if laudry soap was being rationed outside. It is being rationed here. For about 3 weeks the canteen sold no soap. When it did come in, they sold 1 box to a family./I always seem to rattle on and on about myself. Pretty soon I'll be writing an autobiography./I do hope you are just fine! I can just see you scurrying around the library without a moment of rest. Please don't overwork yourself and be doubly careful of your health for these wintery days are certainly cold./Most sincerely,/Louise Ogawa/Please do write during your leisure time.","Letter to Helen McNary from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, November 30, 1942","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Transcription:<br>September 28, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/Thank you very kindly for your lovely letter and the two wonderful books you sent to Florence and me./ I think your stationery is truly nice because it matches and you can write longer letters to me as I am always happy to receive long letters./I do not know where the Indians moved but on the way mother saw a few on the bus as she came into Poston. Although I have not seen any here it certainly would be a thrill to me if I could actually see a true Indian or two./We are all patiently waiting for our winter clothing, but as yet they have not arrived./I can just picture San Diego as it now looks. I imagine the downtown's are not as crowded as before. Are you still riding theose old, old streetcars which give you the feeling that they will break down before they reach the next block?/Uncle Sam needs every bit of rubber etc. so I would not be at least surprised to hear that you are going from place to place on bicycles or skates./Yes, it is hard to have friends and relatives go and to know some are not coming back. but it truly pitiful to see these tiny Japanese children grow up without their fathers as many of them have been taken. I know the whole world is praying for everlasting peace and goodwill toward men./I am very disappointed that we do not have a library in Poston, but I hope they will have one soon. There is no library here as I said, but we have movies here every Saturday night beneath the Arizona stars. Last Saturday we saw ""Abraham Lincoln"" with Walter Houston. I enjoyed the picture very much as Abraham Lincoln is my favorite president and one of the greatest men that ever lived. I do not know how to say this after all the wonderful books you sent me, but I would be more than pleased to receive a book about Abraham Lincoln./How could Louise and I ever judge you harshly after all those happy hours you have given us through your books and letters? Truly words cannot be expressed how grateful we are to you./ Thomas was 8 months old on the 27th. We weighed and measured him yesterday. His weight was 22 lbs., and his height was 30 inches. He can turn over now and tries to stand at every opportunity he gets. I have a feeling he is going to walk and not crawl, but I may be wrong again for he can turn completely around by himself./Florence seems much happier here than Santa Anita for she has her little friends whom she played with in San Diego. Her friends are over our ""apartment"" or she is over theirs. Florence and I are anxiously waiting for school which is going to start on the 5th of October. If luck is with me I have a chance working part time as a typist and going to school. Of course I will be paid for that job then I will not have to trouble my folks for for the necessities when school begins./Just before we left Santa Anita I asked my girl friend to buy some things for me, but in the future I will trouble you for our errands./Florence was so happy she asked me to help her write a letter to you. I hope you can make it out for she has written it with a pencil./ Please give my best regards to Miss McNary./Sincerely,/Margaret IshinoSEPT. 28, 1942/DEAR MISS BREED /THANK YOU FOR THE BOOK. /THE WEATHER IS STILL HOT AND DUSTY./PLEASE SAY ""HELLO"" TO MISS MC NARY./Florence","Letter to Clara Breed from Margaret Ishino, Poston, Arizona, September 28, 1942","Ishino, Margaret",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope in two parts from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>Camp #3 323-11-D / Poston, Arizona / September 8. 1942 / Dear Miss Breed, / Thank you again for the many cross-word puzzles and your nice letter. Your account of your Arizona friend was very interesting and quite amusing. / I have enclosed a copy of a song which should be sung to the tune of ""Oh Susannah."" I ran across it a few days ago and think that it is clever and very briefly tells how the various groups moved into Santa Anita. / Our exit was quite a different story. The first group to move out was the ""Volunteer Group"" which left for Poston on Wednesday morning. Then, the San Diego group left on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Then the Hollywood group left for Wyoming on the following Tuesday and through the rest of the week. Part of Los Angeles which registered with the Maryknoll Church also went to Wyoming. Many more groups from Los Angeles will leave for Colorado with the remaining groups leaving for Arkansas. / Fuji and Bill will probably leave for Colorado about the 15th of this month. I have not heard from her yet and am wondering how she is. We have been told that we are able to join the immediate family after all are relocated.  We are waiting for them to be relocated, and also waiting to see if my brother will be able to get out and go to school. If he should be able to get out we want to join my sister. We may stay here or we may be able to go to Louisiana and join my father there. We have been told that we may be able to join him later, but that it would be impossible for him to join us. /OH FELLOW CAMPERS / Tune: Oh Susanna / I / To Santa Anita 'Sembly Camp we came / from different parts / And yet the friends we have at home / we still keep in our hearts, / We came in trains and caravans and / trucks and buses, too, / Hoping that we'll soon go back, that / skies will soon be blue. / Chorus: / Oh fellow Campers, Let's do our part / right here / And make this place a kind of home / that can mean something dear. / II / Wilmington and Pedro way, Lomita and / Long Beach, / And Frisco town to Diego land, ""good-bye"" / We've said to each. / We're all a-mingled here right now / We've found that joy in life, / Means sharing and a helping out through / Happytime or strife. / III / Downey and the Lawndale folks / Came next to join our group / And then we had 10,000 strong / A var-i-ated group. / Los Angeles and San Mateo / Came into our crowd / Our population at its top / You bet we're mighty proud! / 2 / September 14, 1942 / Dear Miss Breed, / You must be surprised at the various assortment of stationary, but I ran out and am now waiting for some new stationary to come in. / A few nights ago it became really cold. Some people say it went as low as 50 F. It certainly was a change from our usual weather. The days are still very warm but the evenings are much cooler. / We are all getting used to the weather and dust and beginning to think that it isn't such a bad place after all. Partitions have been put up in the lavatory and the wash room here is much nicer and much closer. All of us hang our washed clothing inside the house but it is amazing to note how fast they dry. / We have each been given a cot bed and a blanket. Now that we have caught up on our sleep, the cots feel rather uncomfortable. We will be issued either hay or steel army cots and matresses, but as yet no one seems to know when! Something should be done, though, because we need something as a mattress because it is colder at night. / Many rumors are going on saying that our Sears clothing has come but no one has seen them so I don't believe it. My motto here is ""Seeing only is believing."" I like to tell you of these many many rumors becuase that is just about the best way to let you know what is going on ""inside."" / We have a daily press bulletin, but they are only issued to offices. I wish they would issue it about two or three times a week and let everyone see","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Poston, Arizona, September 8, 1942","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Transcription:<br>Block 329-13-G / Poston, Arizona / October 20, 1942 / Dear Miss McNary, / This is the little black samble Louise wondering how you have been. I haven't written for so long that I'm ashamed of myself. If you happen to see a red glow before your eyes think nothing about it because it's just the reflection from my face. I bet the library is sworming with students now! / Here in Poston the weather is gradually getting cooler, but it is still hot. In the morning, it is very chilly but as the time ticks away it gets warmer and warmer. I imagine in San Diego it is raining. So far we had 2 rainy days. The funny thing about it was--it was hot from early morn. Towards sunset it became a little windy. Then after supper--6:30 P.M.--the wind blew, the rain poured, the thunder roared, and the lightning flashed. The wind was very strong. It tore down a few doors. Everyone was waiting for the roofs to blow off so they can have wood to make tables, chairs, closets etc. But there was no such luck. Then the next day it was hot again. / School has finally begun. I am a senior now, but I am not sure if I got credit for the last semester. When we graduate, we are going to receive California diplomas. I am taking the following subjects: / 1st &amp; 2nd period - Miss Warvorwsky / History and English (we are now studying the history of Poston) / 3rd period - part time work as reader. / 4th "" - Shorthand II Mr. Nishimoto / 5th "" - work / 6th "" - Physiology - Mr. Anderson. Rumors are that he wears a wig. / 7th &amp; 8th - work. / Many of the rooms are not furnished with tables, chairs as yet. So we have to take our own chairs. The lower grades have tables. / I am working part time as a reader. Margaret Ishino is working too. We sit in the office and wait for teachers to bring in their papers to be corrected. I go to school at 8:00 A.M. until 12 noon. Then from 1:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M. Then I either wash, iron, or play. / October 17th, 18th and 19th there was a County Fair which was held in Camp 1. Emi Himaka, Haruko + Kikuye Kawamoto, and I went to the fair on Saturday. We rode on an army truck to Camp 1.Camp 1 does not differ very much from Camp 3. The fair reminded me of a carnival. There were many game booths. And, of course, stands where various foods were sold. Many things were on display. Many future plans were on display too. Many Japanese foods are going to be planted. Noodles are already being made in Camp 1. There is a poultry farm too. At present there are 50 chickens. A pork farm is going to be located between Camp 1 and Camp 2. Many things are going to be made here and sold to the outside--exports. The thing I enjoyed the most was the Arts and Craft display. Many clever things were made from trunks and branches of trees. There are many talented people here. I wish you were there to enjoy it with me. / As you may have noticed, I have moved. I am now living in Block 329-13-G; Poston, Arizona. I am not living with my step-mother any more as you can imagine how busy I am washing, ironing, cleaning the house, and going to school. I never realized how men can dirty their clothes. I am kept busy but I will try to write more often. / I suppose you remember about the clothing allowance. Well, we finally received them. I received: / 1 red bedroom slipper / 1 flannel pajama / 8 prs. of sock / 1 slip / 1 wool slacks / I was hoping the skirt and jerkin set would come but to my disappointment it did not. But I am grateful to receive such nice things. / I told you in my last letter that we do not have mattresses, but now we have straw mattresses. It softens and warms the bed. My, once I start writing I never seem to stop. It's time for me to go to bed so I'll say good-nite and please take care of yourself since it's getting colder each day. / Most sincerely, / Louise Ogawa","Letter to Helen McNary from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, October 20, 1942","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>322-14-D / Poston, Arizona / December 1, 1942 / Dear Miss Breed, / We received your package today, a very pleasant surprise indeed! You should have seen the looks of pleasure on the faces of our friends with whom we were able to share the candy and nuts, especially the coffee candy and rum and toffee. Receiving things from the outside is such a rarety that most of us share what we receive no matter how little it is. / I gave Mrs. Ohye the brick design crepe as well as the crepe with the children design you see she is interested in the nursery dept. of our school. By the way she is a certified teacher of the Los Angeles School System. She sends her thanks and says she certainly can make use of the paper. / To Mrs. Umezawa went one package of pipe cleaners. She also sends her thanks. Yes, she is the one of whom your mother speaks of as ""the missionary lady."" She is teaching flower-making under the Industries Dept. / Mrs. Kushino and Mrs. Hirai and also little Jane Kushino send thanks for the candy and crepe paper that I was able to share. So does Mrs. Nakamura. No, this Mrs. Nakamura was from Santa Maria before coming to San Diego. / I am glad you liked what little I was able to send you. The pins weren't too hard to make, perhaps because there isn't much size to it. They were my first pins and took several days to make. The nameplate was the hardest to make. It took me about 14 solid hours of work to finish it. My choice of wood was bad because instead of a sharp division between the sap wood and the heart wood of the mesquite there was a gradual darkening, so that I had to cut quite deep before a contrasting color was reached. On the knot pin the name was burned after being carved to give it that black finish. / As to the tools I used, there weren't many. Most of the work was done with a pocket knife, but for the fine work I used a cutter fashioned from a discarded dentist's drill. (By the way if you know any dentists who have old tools of any sort, drills, chisels, etc. that are ready for the scrap heap, could you have him send them here?) In making your nameplate I took an old bedspring and made an 1/8 inch chisel so that it would be easier to carve around the letters. So many people want pins and nameplates made that I am swamped. It may be several weeks before I can work on new requests. However send in the names and also a pin for each as I am out of pins. The W.R.A. wage scale is approximately 8 1/2 c. per hour for me when and if we're paid. On the average a five-letter pin takes about five hours of actual working time. Sometimes a letter cracks off so the pin is made all over again. It happens quite often in names that have a dot and also ""E"". So for the first five letters 40 c. - 5 c. for each letter thereafter. / I haven't decided what to charge for the nameplates. I doubt if I'll make very many as it takes too much time and that means not enough time to make pins. / By the way you haven't sent me your mother's name. / I was interested to hear that Howard Pease is in S.D. I certainly wish I were there to meet him. His books used to give me many a thrill. I can still remember Tod Moran and many of his adventures on the high seas and at foreign ports. Yessiree Howard Pease's characters really lived. / Here in Poston we have a Dept. of Sociological Research whose job it is to record the effects of the evacuation. Every now and then I have a ""bull session"" with one of the fellows who work in the dept. We discuss why we don't get along with people from other areas, juvenile delinquency, church attendance, schools, gossipers and their effect on the community, human behavior in general, nisei vs. issei (first generation) and so on into the night. Thus far we haven't gotten very far with definite conclusions, but the Research Dept. has made quite a number of surveys which have brought out interesting sidelights. I haven't talked with my friend","Letter to Clara Breed from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki, Poston, Arizona, December 1, 1942","Hirasaki, Tetsuzo",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

The fellows that she was going to visit left camp to go to the sugar beet fields, so that the trip here was called off. Maybe when the fellows get back she will make the trip. I don't know much about her except that she is a cousin of some sort to Gen. MacArthur. She has been a bookkeeper for a produce house (Greenman &amp; Sons) for quite a long time. That was where she became aquainted with Japanese She is the mother of one of my classmates in S. D. High School. She used to come to Santa Anita almost every week end to visit the boys that used to know her in S.D./Thanks for the news of Mr. Campione.

It seems that there is a possibility that many of the internees are to be released sometime close to Christmas (that's what the rumors have it) Almost everyone who has someone in an internment camp believe that his someone is the one coming home. At any rate the Alien Enemy Control at Washington is considering to allow the families to join the husbands in the internment camp. Many of us have written Edward J. Ennis, Director of the Alien Enemy Control unit asking that it be the other way around. --Yes Fusa's dad is still interned./I am still working in the mess hall.

Have been doing a little carpentry as many of us here have no furniture other than cots. Haven't got much made here in my own apt. as most of my work is over where the menfolk have left for the sugar beet fields or where there just ain't no menfolk./The food has been all right except for quantity. We still have trouble with the warehouse transportation system. Also transportation on the outside to bring food all the way from the Coast here to Poston is limited. The medical situation here is pitiful. For that matter in all three camps. The main and the only hospital is at Camp I 15 miles away.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed + program for a get-together of all the girls clubs.  Transcription:<br>Santa Anita Assembly Center/Dist. 5 F-27-5/Arcadia, California/August 20, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,I guess it must be my turn to write to you because I have not heard from you recently. Thank you for sending me the puzzles and also for going to all the trouble of cutting them out of the daily papers for me./I think that I must have forgotten to thank you for sending me the book, too. I read it and two days later it was loaned out and it has been going around ever since. About ten different people have read it and it is still circulating. It was very interesting and was a little different from most of the ""career books"" because it told of failure as well as fortune. ""Frills and Thrills"" really showed the back angle of modelling./One of the advantages in this camp is the time to read some of the classic literature which I didn't read at home. Since there are not many new books I am trying to catch up in the classic literature. I have read quite a few short story books and some fiction books./It seems as though we are going to move soon. We have been having many departmental dances. Last week I went to the Finance division dance and also the Camouflage unit dance. They were both very nice. It was quite a novelty to dance on a smooth floor and inside and also to have eats during the dance. Usually dances are held on the side of the grandstand and under the stars. We never have refreshments except at home. We miss a drive-in or something cool to drink after the dances. The canteens close at 5:30 so it is impossible to keep drinks cool after that./The other night the girls' clubs held a jamboree. It is something like the girls' hi-jinx at school. Our club, the Kappa Gammas were supposed to do a strip tease act, but we backed out. We did help out with decorating the stage, though. It started out rather corny, but as time went on it really was something worth seeing. I have enclosed a copy of the program which I hope you will find interesting. I will tell you about the skits which placed first, second, and third. First was the Santa nooga Choo choo, which part of the girls sang while other brought forth on the stage a choo choo train. As the train was turning round and round trees and cities passed by. It was cute and very well done. During the song some girls kept shouting ""Poston, here we come!""/Second, which I thought was the best, was Scrap Fashions. This was really beautiful. It showed that a great deal of work had been put into making the outfits. They were all made of tissue paper gotten from the mess halls and also toilet paper (which we call ration paper). They had a play suit, a date dress, and also a wedding dress. The wedding dress really was a masterpiece. This skit ended with the offer of the whole trousseau to anyone who intended to get married in the near future./Third was ""Cindy Ella"" a blackface story of ""Cinderella."" It was cute and very well acted. It was modernized with a geta for the slipper./You must be very busy with the summer vacation coming to an end. You never did tell me about your vacation. My brother got a letter from your sister in Berkeley. I don't know whether he has answered her or not./My sister and her husband are celebrating their first wedding anniversary on the 31st. I am making him a pair of sox, while my mother is crocheting them a beautiful runner. I got my sister some cologne which I think she will enjoy./I haven't mentioned food very much lately, have I? Well, on the whole it is good. We have good and bad days here. I guess we're so used to the food we don't say much about it now. We groan in the mess hall when it is awful, but that's about all. I think that I must have lost a little bit of weight because my wrist watch has moved up a fraction of an inch up my arm. Gee, I'm curious to see how much I weigh now./According to the latest rumors the way we are going to go o","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Arcadia, California, August 20, 1942","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Helen McNary.  Transcription:<br>Sept. 17, 1942/Dear Miss McNary,/I received your letter dated August 31st today. I certainly was glad to hear from you! It stayed in Santa Anita for about 2 weeks. I imagine you were wondering when I was going to answer your letter. It certainly took a long time for them to forward it to me, but I imagine they were quite busy./You probably have heard all about Poston, Arizona from Miss Breed. We are living in the No. 3 Camp. If not I shall be more than happy to inform you of my new home./Miss McNary, I wish I could take a natural colored picture of myself to show you that it's pretty hard ot compete in the sun-tanning contest with me. But unfortunately we are not allowed to have cameras. But we are allowed to carry flashlights. Miss McNary, I would just love to have a picture of you!!!/I am glad to hear you had a nice vacation. I was with you in spirit at the beach. Sorry you were not able to come and see us during your stay in Los Angeles. My stay there would have been perfect if you came to see us./I am working as a waitress at the present time. I am going to school when it opens October 5th. I am most happy to know that I'll be able to finish high school. My teachers are coming from California to teach us. It certainly would be nice if some of my former teachers came!/The Government gave us a clothing allowance for the months we were in Santa Anita. I was allowed $13.00 for the 4 months. We were given a list of items from which we could order through the Sears catalog. Thinking we were going to a cold place, everyone ordered winter clothes--wool slacks, heavy sweaters, wool skirts, heavy shirts etc. If we were informed as to where we were going we would have ordered things to suit the climate of Poston. Unfortunately we were not. As yet we have not received our clothing./Poston is a wonderful place--way out in the open spaces. It would be paradise if it were not for the dust, heat and the insects./It was very interesting to read about San Diego. I could imagine what a change the dim out has made./There seems to be a urgent call for farmers all over the United States. Many of the San Diego boys are going out of this camp to Oregon, Utah, Colorado, Idaho to help with the farm work--picking cotton, tomato, beets etc. I heard they are to return here in a few months for there is no work in those states during the winter time. But while there if they find work outside, they can call their family over there and stay permanently. Of course, then no Govt. help will be provided for they are on their own. My girl friend is in Colorado and she informed me that because of the labor shortage the schools are open just half a day. All the school children help out in the fields the rest of the day./Have you had a blackout recently? I certainly miss them! During our first blackout in San Diego we had so much excitement at home--bumping into doors, tables, chairs; trying to dress in the dark; father taking a bath in the dark etc. Here there is no curfew or blackouts. I guess it is far enough inland to it isn't necessary to have any./There rings the dinner bell!! My tummy has been growling for hours so I'd better run!!/Please write soon and keep trying--maybe you'll win over me in that blackout competition yet! Hope you'll always be in the best of health./Most sincerely,/Louise Ogawa/My address is: /Block 330/Bldg. 12 Apt. B/Poston, Arizona/Ps. I thought your stationary was darling!!

I hope you are in the best of health!!!/Since school has not started yet I decided to do something else besides washing, ironing, and cleaning the rooms. I finally got a job as a waitress. Once I start serving tea I don't know whether I am coming or going. There is not enough girls so we serve 3 or 4 tables, and it certainly keeps us busy./We now have a newspaper called the Santa Anita Pacemaker. It is published twice a week. I thought maybe you would like to read it so I was going to send it to you, but my mother threw it away. I shall send the next publication to you./There are about 11,984 people in this assembly center now. The capacity for this center is estimated to be between 17,000 and 18,000.

I was overwhelmed with joy to see the books when the postman opened the package for inspection. I cannot express in words my feeling of gratitude./I want to thank you so much that I feel like writing pages and pages of ""Thank you, Miss Breed, Thank you!"" But I shall not for I must conserve on paper. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. The first thing I did after receiving the books was run to my parents and show them the nice books. Then I ran to Margaret Ishino and showed them to her. I was so happy I had to show them to someone./Yesterday began my third week in Santa Anita. It is a beautiful place. It is the first time I have been here and I enjoy it very much. The weather differs greatly from San Diego. It is cold and rainy one day and the next day it is as hot as it could be./Since I have been here I visited Seabiscuit's statue and have gone around the race track a few times./We are fed three meals a day and the food is just fine. This is just like an army camp for the store is called a canteen and the cafeteria is called a mess hall. Everyday a line is, which people refer to as a bread line, formed leading to the mess hall when meal time is near. This line is blocks and blocks long. I often wait an hour or two before entering the mess hall. The mess hall is a huge room. The other morning I was the one thousandth person to enter it../It took me a while to get use to my new home, but I am quite use to it now. I am sleeping where Seabiscuit used to sleep, I hope. ""I am sleeping where Seabiscuit used to sleep"" is a common saying around here./School has not started yet and I am getting lonesome for homework. I heard we are going to have a library soon. It was the best news I have heard. I just love to read. By just looking at the books you sent, I recall the days when I use to walk to the library and have you help me find a nice book to enjoy./The first week after we arrived, father, brother, sister, and I went everyday to the scrap wood pile to find wood to make our furnitures. We finally gathered enough wood to make a few tables and chairs. After looking at the results I thought of the primitive people who did what we did today./But bitter feelings do not enter my head because I know we were sent to Santa Anita Assembly Center for our own protection. I am grateful to the Govt. for gathering us in such a nice place. If I am helping the Govt. by staying here, I am glad. I want so much to be of some use to the Govt./My! all I have been doing is talking about myself. Now I would like to know how you are and all about San Diego. I imagine many students come to the library to get reference books. I wish I was still among them! I seem to be going on and on like the ticking of a clock, but the running out of ink has told me to stop.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Helen McNary.  Transcription:<br>November 11, 1942/Dear Miss McNary,/This is Louise who is getting blacker and blacker by the minute in sunny Arizona. Since the last time I wrote nothing exciting has occurred. We are all fine and I hope you will receive this letter in the best of health too./Saturday, Nov. 7th, I experienced something I shall never forget. I went cotton picking with my school-mates to raise funds so the school will be able to have a school paper. We left home at 8:30 A.M. on a cattle truck. We were going bumpity bump down the narrow dirt road when all of a sudden we came to a halt. We quickly jumped to our feet and saw a little house. In it sat a military police who counted us like cattles. Then we were again winding through the Mosquite trees until finally we were surrounded by cotton plants. We all cried, ""Well, here we are--let's get busy!"" After piling out of the truck like ants, we were given a large sack in which to put the cotton. This bag was very very long. It weighed 2 lbs and often got in our way. We flung the bag over our left shoulder and began picking the cotton. It certainly was a good thing that I wore slacks and a long sleeve blouse for you get scratched all over. I often crawled on the ground to pick the fallen cottons. I picked the long staple cotton./A.--long staple cotton--small cotton which is hard to pick--the price is 4 c. a lb./B.--short staple cotton--large cotton which is much easier to pick but the price is 1 c. a lb./I hate to mention how much I picked but I'll be bold and tell you. But before I do promise me you won't laugh! I picked only 14 lbs. Now, isn't that sad? I only made 56 c. for the school. But when you add up all the students who picked 14 lbs. I guess the amount will be much greater. If I ever have a chance to go again I'll try to pick much more. At least this time I'll know how to go about it. You see, we were given no instructions as to how we should pick it. We were told to pick everything that was white either on the plants or on the ground./Cotton picking certainly is a boring job. It is no wonder that the negroes have developed such a talent in singing. But I enjoyed it tremendously. We also sang songs and cracked jokes while working./Do you remember Emi Himaka and Kikuye Kawamoto (one of the twins)? Well, in the morning Emi picked 4 lbs. and Kikuye picked 5 lbs. and I picked 6 lbs. But my other friend who is formerly from Visalia picked 8 lbs. Then in the afternoon Emi, Kikuye, and I together picked 18 lbs. We put all the cotton together in one bag. Emi carried the bag. Emi and I had to carry the bag together to take it to be weighed. We didn't expect it to weigh 18 lbs. Even though we didn't accomplish as much as we would have liked to we had a great deal of enjoyment./We stopped work about 4:30 P.M. and were taken to the trading post which is about 8 miles on this side of Parker. The trading post was one of thise country stores where they sold from shoes to food. There were many Indians there. That is where they do their shopping./One thing I missed was water. It was like being in the middle of a desert. When we arrived at the trading post, we ran in the store expecting to buy a soda. But to our disappointment no cold drinks were sold. Even though I had no water and came home exhausted I enjoyed every minute of it. It certainly felt good to get home!!/Today all the elderly people and invalids received a mattress. My father received one but I'm still a spring chicken so the straw mattress is good enough for me!/Oh by the way, this is how I looked when I went cotton picking: [drawing] Please use your imagination for it'll help alot./<br>I have heard linoleums are going to be laid on the mess hall floors. I think this is wonderful!/Since school began the first school affair was the Junior Jubilee. It was a social put on by the Junior class. It was very successful. The seniors are planning to have a social too. I hope this w","Letter to Helen McNary from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, November 11, 1942","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Mrs. Araki certainly was pleased to receive those pictures. The reason I didn't ask for my picture was that I hadn't seen it yet. I certainly would be glad to have a copy. /In regards to your contemplated trip to Santa Anita Saturday--I certainly would be glad to see you, but under the circumstances I don't believe that would be possible. You see, it's like this: According to regulations here, the inductee must apply for a permit for her friend to visit at least five days in advance. She must also send a letter or post card to the friend telling them the day and hour in which to come. This letter acts as a pass for the friend. The visiting hours are between two and four any day. I have to pass two gates in order to see you, and cannot get pass them without a pass. Don't you think it would be a better idea if you postponed your trip one more week? If you will write to me and let me know the exact date of your trip about a week in advance I certainly would be glad and able to see you./I enjoyed hearing about the San Diego blackout. I have had two other letters telling me about it. One had a clipping about the lady who turned on the shower instead of the tub water and got all wet! Another one told me about her sister jumping into bed with her, and in her mad scrambling pulling and breaking the curtain rod. Some people certainly get excited don't they!/The day the signing for sugar rations came up all of us thought ""Well, at least we won't have to stand in line for that!"" The first week we were here, we were just sick of standing in line to wait for things, but now we don't give it another thought!/My sister is here and lives quite a distance from us but close to the place I work. I am working as timekeeper--a very soft job, but it takes up most of my day. Since the month is over, some of us are supposed to get paid. No one knows how we are going to get paid or when. It's really funny because everyone is passing rumors and yet no one knows./I asked my sister if she knew Mrs. Minshall and Mrs. Fletcher. She evidently pictured someone in her mind, but couldn't put it with the name. All she said was ""Probably, I knew them by their maiden name."" Could that be true? Well, my sister has a terrible memory for names, but not faces. /When you come up would you please bring me some magazines (old ones will do) and a Gregg shorthand book which was copyrighted in 1936, and some sweets. I'll repay you when my first check comes. /Sincerely/Fusa Tsumagari/P.S.

Transcription:<br>323-11-D/Poston, Arizona/October 9, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/ This is the first chance I have had to thank you for sending me the dictionary and also they book ""The Person You Want to Be."" I certainly do want to thank you for sending me both of them. The book you sent me certainly is essential here because we have a tendency to get ""sloppy"" and not care about our appearance any more. It certainly is worth reading and trying out some of the things taught in the book./Right now I am working in the Construction Office as a so called Secretary. Gee, I really don't work hard at all. My boss is in Camp #1 most of the time and comes her about once a day. Our job here is to keep the time of the Carpenters and to make requisitions. If anyone needs tables, chairs, or benches, we make out the requisitions and send them to the Carpenter Shop. Right now the shop is busy making tables for the schools. The greatest difficulty is getting the supplies. We really are short on lumber and nails./About two nights ago we had an electrical storm. This was our first experience in a storm here. All day clouds formed in the sky. About dusk the clouds were really grey making the place seem dark. Then the winds began to blow. The dust just whirled and began to dance around like a ""jitterbug."" The wind started to howl almost as loud as the coyotes at night. Then, lightening, then of course, thunder. Then, rain! We were all inside the house, but we were well aware that our top roofs were threatening to blow off. Our stove pipe hole, (which has yet to be filled with a pipe) began to let in the torrent of rain and dirt. We had to move our belonging from there. After that, we were all comfortable and tried to forget the rain. That was rather exciting and quite a change from the usual sun shine and dust flying all over./ A few days ago we were given hay for our mattresses. We did not like the idea at first because we had heard that there are bugs, etc. which could possibly breed in them. However, they are not as bad as we expected. The only thing wrong is that they sag in company with the body and stay that way. We have to reshape our mattresses every night. The hay certainly keeps us much warmer than we thought possible./Last Monday school started. We watched all the students taking their own chairs to school and regretted the fact that we had already gotten out of school. There are about 20 Caucasian teachers in Camp 3. They certainly represent a variety of states. There are some from Oklahoma, New York, Virginia, and California. Most of the teachers are rather on the old side. There is one male teacher who lives in a trailer. All the students who have him tell me that he wears a wig. They claim that they can see the stitching on his wig. I don't know how true that is, but it sounds just like a rumor we used to hear about a teacher in junior high school./ Next week evening shorthand classes begin. I am planning to attend and really make use of Miss McNary's Shorthand Book. At the present time one of the secretaries is using it, and brushing up on her shorthand----she has to take down every word spoken at certain meetings and is relearning the brief forms./My sister arrived in Colorado (Amache branch of Lamar). Over there the facilities are yet very incomplete. Their houses are built much more substantially and they have brick floors and a stove in each unit. They said that they had a very enjoyable train ride with really good food on the train. All the letters I received tell me that the worst scenery was, of course, in Arizona. All they saw was miles and miles of desert country. Gee, as if we didn't know it!/Friends in Wyoming tell  me that it is dusty and cold there, but they have stoves and can have as much coal as they want. We heard that Arkansas wasn't bad at all! Gee, everyone was saying that Arizona and Arkansas would be the worst.

We have all girls in our room so we call it the girls dormitory. / The Sheep Wagon Family book was very interesting. I like adventure books very much. The book, Story Parade is very nice. I read one story each day. Our library shelf is getting very crowded because of all the books you sent us. Pretty soon my father is going to make us a bigger shelf.

This morning our mush had raisins because there wasn't any sugar. / The Sunday School is quite big now. There are about 700 children.

It has improved a great deal. There are now shelves provided for adult books, for the intermediate age, and books for children of Florence's age. There are still many magazines as before. I wish you could see our library. For such a small space it occupies, it is well organized. / Do you go to the library convention annually? It must be an interesting experience, even though it keeps you so busy. / If we may have cameras I will be more than glad to snap a picture of Thomas for you. In about a week and a half he will be 5 months old. He certainly is growing chubbier every day. / Here is another picture Florence drew of a houseboat. She sends it to you with her regards. / Incidentally we moved to another part of the center. Our address is: / District VII / Barrack 12, Unit 5, 8th Street / Santa Anita Assembly Center / Arcadia, California / Thank you again most graciously, and may you have a pleasant trip to the East.","Letter to Clara Breed from Margaret Ishino, Arcadia, California, June 16, 1942","Ishino, Florence",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Last night I couldn't stop reading and mother had to tell me to turn off the light. The lights have to be off by 10:00 P.M. and oh, how I wished it could be on until I finished it. I sometimes wish I could experience what Molly did.  And how thrilling that would be. I think the pictures are just lovely. They've impressed me very much./I wish I could express my gratitude in another way besides saying ""Thank you from the bottom of my heart."" Maybe in the near future I will be able to show you how much I appreciate everything you have done for me. Thank you!/We are going to be given clothing--today we handed in our order. I am allowed $2.85 a month. We are allowed to order just certain things from the Sears catalog. I think we are very fortunate to be given clothing and free coupon books./The weather here is very unpredictable. It was either Monday or Tuesday (Aug. 10-11)--for weeks and weeks it was extremely hot then all of a sudden the next day it began to pour. But the next day it was again very hot./I am working on a three shift right now. This means I work morning, noon, and night.--8 hrs. a day. This does not give me much time to do anything. I go washing in the evening after work and do my ironing and corresponding at that time too. I should have written to you sooner but I hope you will accept my apologies./Please give my best to Miss McNary and thanks a million times more for the book!/Most sincerely,/Louise Ogawa/Aug.    , 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/The time has come again for me to say ""good-bye"" until I hear from you again at my new home. I intended to write to you sooner thanking you for the mdse. I ordered. I received it with great satisfaction. Thank you ever so much. My friends advised me to delay my letter writing because in a few days the notices to leave will come--and as said, it has come. We, San Diegans, are going to leave Santa Anita for Parker, Arizona on Wednesday or Thursday. (Aug. 26, 27) We are going in two groups - one on Wed. the other on Thursday./It seems that we are going further and further away from San Diego but I hope to be back soon. I never have gone to Arizona and so I am sure it will be a new adventure to me. We are again leaving by train right after our supper--Wed. The camp is in an up roar just talking about evacuation. Today is my last day at work for I must wash, iron, and pack. It reminds me of the day when I left San Diego./I hope you will write often. Since I'll be far far away from home I will be more than happy to hear from you./My friend has made a pair of ""geta"" which I am sending you. I hope you will enjoy it.

The only thing to really look forward to here is eating and receiving mail./As yet there are no vacancies for the jobs I applied for. I inquired this morning about doing volunteer work in the Recreation Department but it seems no openings are expected until next week sometime. In the meantime, I am going to do observance work with the various age groups which range from 5 to 12 years of age. The school hours are from 9 to 11 in the morning and 2 to 4 in the afternoon. The children are marked down for clean hair, teeth and hands, somewhat like regular school. The younger children enjoy games such as New York, Ring around the Rosy and such. The older boys have regular games of softball and you should see the crowd that turns out to see the boys play. (Boys over 12)./The food is very good and now the Red mess hall where the San Diego group eats is divided into 3 groups. We have red buttons numbered 1, 2, and 3. The San Diego group is all in the number 1 group./There is a canteen where various items are sold such as ice cream, candies, cigarettes, household necessities and it seems that more foods are being added daily. Yesterday, potato chips, pies and cakes were sold for the first time and they certainly did sell out quickly./ I hope I have helped you in getting somewhat of a picture of what is what here, although very sketchily. The books would certainly be deeply appreciated since the ones we did bring up here have been longsince read and sometimes re-read. /Thank you again for your letter and many thanks for your kind thought. /Sincerely,/Yoshiko Kubo","Letter to Clara Breed from Yoshiko Kubo, April 23, 1942","Kihara, Yoshiko Kubo",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>July 16, 1942/Dear Miss Breed, /Thank you for everything. First of all it was grand to see you and then on top of that to receive such nice gifts from you. I really liked your clever way of wrapping each of the sox in little packages. One of the fellows who was at my home at the time I opened the gifts exclaimed ""I don't see how girls get such a kick out of wrapping and unwrapping gifts!"" So you see--I really showed my enthusiasm over receiving such nice things from you./Yesterday (though I am loath to tell you) I finally took the candies and soaps to Louise. I should have taken them sooner but was busy in the evenings./My job is very easy but has rush days usually on the 15th and the 30th. I have just finished my work so am writing you./I am living in an ideal place. All our neighbors are grown up so we don't have to put up with a lot of baby crying. An interesting part of living in barracks has not been mention to you before. Since each barrack looks alike almost all the families have put their names on the door in some fashion. Some have painted signs, others engraved in wood and even others with bent wires spelling out their names. The result is quite interesting and gives each home individuality. One of the most original places has a huge doll made of burlap, with wood shavings for hair, button eyes and made of anything found within the center. (She is sitting on a large branch of a tree) Beside her is a sign which reads ""I am Lula Belle, the Belle of Santa Anita"" then another sign which reads ""I am looking for a fellow with an income of $8 or more a month with a hollow chest + thick waist. Many a joke has been played on unsuspecting persons by their being dragged all the way out to meet Lulu Belle!/Another interesting decoration is a monkey whose face has been molded out of torn up strips of burlap. He is sitting on a tree made of burlap./Then, there are a deer and a dog, and a duck made from branches of trees. Really very clever!/One of the most beautiful is a barrel which has been cut into about 3/4 of its size and has a triangular top making it look like a well. The barrel has water in it with pebbles on the bottom and has all kinds of broken glass hanging from the roof. They tinkle and make a very beautiful noise./I am really impressed with the ingenuity of some of the people./In regards to your galloon question--according to the catalogues they have scalloped edges and are about one to two inches wides and have a design inside. Something like this: [drawing of lace] I hope you catch on now!/Self government has been disbanded for the present. I guess permanently too! I will write you more about that later if you remind me too./Thanks a lot for all your kindness. Until I hear from you again I remain Sincerely yours,/Fusa.","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Arcadia, California, July 16, 1942","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

Transcription:<br>S.A.A.C./Dist 5 F-27-5/Arcadia, Calif./August 3, 1942/Dear Miss Breed,/On Friday morning I certainly received a surprise package! It was more of a surprise because no letter came until Saturday. Really, you should not have gone to all that trouble. It was very nice of you to get two such lovely dresses plus a nice picture and powder puffs. It was also very thoughtful of Miss McNary to send me the candy. You shouldn't go to all that trouble and expense for me. Thank you very much./As I have told you before, rumors fly thick and fast. Most of us are expecting to be relocated soon. We've heard that we will be moved to Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, and Arkansas. I think we will move to either Wyoming or Arkansas. I guess we'll have to wait and see how far from right I am. Gee, wherever we go, we all realize that it will be ""rough going"" because other people have refused to live there before us. We also know that the weather will be nothing like the beautiful California weather. It will probably be very hot or extremely cold. According to rumors the San Diego people will be among the first to be re-evacuated. Officials will not confirm anything because they do not know anything so the obvious result is rumors. Rumors lead to panic--which is really a shame./You know, I've often wondered what some of the other people write to you. Do they write as corny letters as I? Gee, I hope not!/Yesterday we had an airplane show. I helped as one of the recorders again. It was fun, but terribly hot out there. The winners of the last meet really had terrible luck. They won some prizes, but not many. This time the prizes were more evenly divided./One unfortunate incident occurred. The father of one of the contestants fainted from heat exhaustion and also heart failure. He died a few minutes later. None of us knew about it till the meet was over. It was too bad that such a thing had to happen./I'm sorry that I didn't send Eleanor Tasaki's bubble set to her sooner. I kept forgetting and must have had it almost a month before I sent it./Do you know on August 8 it will be exactly four months since we came here. The days certainly fly fast, but the months just crawl by! I hope this war will be over before long./Once again thank you very much for sending me the lovely dresses.

I am still one of the 16,023 in Santa Anita Assembly Center. We are just fine and I hope you are in the best of health too. I am glad you asked some questions because I was puzzled as to what I could write about that would be of interest. Yes, the library is open now to the public. It has a few books but mostly magazines. / The tables at which I serve seat 16 people on one side--32 people can be seated in one table. I do not know in measurements how large it is. To the kitchen, where I work, it is about two miles, but to the kitchen where I eat (when not at work) is about 8 blocks away from home. No, the tea which we drink is not Japanese tea. It is black tea. Oh, if only I knew you were fond of tea--we had quite a bit of tea at home which we packed in a box and stored. It is useless stored away and I'm sure you would have enjoyed it, but I guess it's too late to think of that now. We were all so busy packing and settling our affairs that we didn't stop to think until we arrived here. I guess we were all too excited to think straight. / Yes, I have one sister and 2 brothers. One brother is in Japan. My sister and brother always went to the main library. I have not met many new acquaintances. I have met girls from Gardena, Hawthorne, Downy, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Long Beach. / There are many entertainments for us. Every Saturday evening there is a dance. It is limited to couples only and all the parents are invited. Clubs of girls and boys as well as boy scouts are being organized. Children between the ages of 3-12 yrs. go to school. On May 13, I attended the community singing. It was very enjoyable. Every night there is a baseball game. / I thought maybe you would like to hear about how we wash and iron. Well, first I'll tell you about washing. There is a large community washing place. I drew a sketch of it below. [diagram of long communal basin with seven sets of hot and cold taps on a side] About 100 people can wash at one time. I am not artistic so you will have to excuse my awful drawing and use your imagination. Right now the washing place is the ironing house. There are two washing place and 2 ironing house. Stationary ironing boards have been set up. All we have to furnish is the iron and cord. In another part of the ground are rows and rows of clothes lines. So many people go to wash that often a line is formed similar to that of a lunch line. / As I said in my last letter, I have enclosed 2 issues of our paper. I hope you will enjoy reading it.

I also received the candies and the lock and keys. They were just what mother wanted. Thank you ever so much. We enjoyed the candies tremendously. Thank you a million times more. Now to get down to business. What was the price of the lock and keys including the tax etc.? Now there is a post office here so I will be able to send the amount to you by money order. I sincerely hope I did not cause you too much trouble. / I hope I did not give you the wrong impression of Poston! This is a wonderful place--way out in the open spaces. It would be paradise if it were not for the dust, heat, and the insects. The dust here seems to be very well known. The heat is very hot. Even though it is September it gives me the feeling of July. / Miss Breed, I have been roasting for the past few weeks. Now I am ready to be set on the table and be carved. Miss Breed, I'll bet you a hundred dollars that you won't be able to beat my tan!! / Yesterday, Sept. 15, the temperature was 127 outside and 115 inside. I knew it was very hot but not knowing how high the temperature was, I washed and ironed after coming home from work (2:00--3:30 the hotest time of the afternoon.) As I sit writing this letter, a little creek has formed in the back of my leg. / The San Diego crickets were harmless but very noisey in the evening. But the Poston crickets are very naughty. It eats clothing. I guess, San Diego has the best of everything! The other day I sprinkled my clothes to iron--before I knew it a cricket had made a nice big hole in the back of my skirt. It's just no use sprinkling your clothes because while ironing one shirt all the other sprinkled clothes become dry. So the heat is terrific here. I wonder how it will be when winter rolls around. I may have complained about my new environment but I know it will be difficult to adapt myself to the new surroundings right away. I am sure everything will brighten up soon and in a few more weeks I will begin to love this place almost as much as my home in San Diego. When I stop to think  how the pilgrims started their life, similar to ours, it makes me feel grand for it gives me the feeling of being a pure full-blooded American. / School is going to begin October 5th. Many California teachers are coming here to teach us. Our principal is Mr. Potts. Have you ever heard of him? I was just wondering whether he was from California. I am glad I will be able to finish high school. I imagine the San Diego City Schools will open soon. / The other day we had fresh pears for dinner. It was my first pear in five months. It certainly was delicious!! / Since the Colorado River is three miles from here many boys and girls go swimming and fishing. It certainly is a nice long walk! As yet I have not gone but I hope to soon. If you swim to the other side of the river you are in California, but it is very hard to do because of the strong current. About three boys from Camp 1 and 2 have drowned. / I must get this in this morning's mail so I'll say good bye until I hear from you. I hope you will always be in the best of health. / Most sincerely, / Louise Ogawa / Please give my best to Miss McNary.

Transcription:<br>April 18 '42/Arcadia/Dear Miss Breed,/I am very sorry I haven't written sooner, but I was sick in bed from the typhoid fever shot. There was a sudden change in our going to Owens Valley. But we arrived safely at Santa Anita (which we call Santa Japanita) We started from the station 1:30 a.m. Reached Santa Anita 3:00. Santa Anita is a very beautiful place. You could see the big mountains. In the morning when you could see the shadows of the mountains it looks like the great preyimeds Egypt. Our camp is right near the racetracks of Santa Anita. The stables that the horses used to live in were fived over for us to live in. They gave us many things that we needed like beds, blankets, brooms, and buckets. So we are getting along fine. When we eat we always have to get in a long line about three block. We do not go school yet but we go to the Recreation park to play games. So all we do is eat, play and sleep. But in the evenings I read some of the books I bought. I enjoyed very much to take books out of the library. My mother told me to give your mother her love./Yours always,/Elizabeth Kikuchi/P.S.

I did not realize how long it has been since I last wrote to you until I heard from you. Please forgive the delay. I hope you had a nice trip to Milwaukee! I could imagine what an honor it was for you to award the Newbery Medal. Congratulations! / Here in Santa Anita everything is just fine. The first pay day was on June 20th. My father, sister, and brother were paid for 1 weeks work. I am anxiously awaiting the day when I'll be paid. / We now have a self-governing body here. George Obashi, formerly of S. D. who operated the Ginza and the Obashi Family Beauty Salon, is our district representative. / Many nisei's are helping the Govt. by working on the camouflage. You have to be an American citizen in order to work on it. / Every week we have a sanitary inspection. Blankets and mattresses are all aired weekly. Those who have straw filled matresses are required to change the straw every two weeks. I think this is a splendid plan - sanitary inspections. / Monday, June 22, a beard-growing race began. They are given a week in which to grow their beard. Prizes are to be awarded for the bushiest beard, the scraggliest beard, and the best-trimmed beard. I imagine this contest will be fun and most enjoyable to watch. / Sunday, June 21 - Fathers Day - we had ice-cream and cake for desert. It was enjoyed by everyone. On Monday we had watermelon. Tonight we are going to have it again. I can hardly wait til tonight. It is so delicious. / We now have a Visitor's house. It opened for the first time today. Visiting hours have been lengthened from two to three hours--1 to 4 p.m. daily. The capacity of Visitor's house at any one time is approximately 150 persons. I hope you will be able to come and visit us very soon. / The Board of Education has made it possible for us to receive our credit for the present semester. Now I am a Senior B. I am grateful to the Board of Education for taking such interest in us. / I seem to ramble on and on without asking about you - Miss McNary - and San Diego. I would like to know how things are in San Diego. How are you Miss Breed? I hope you are in the best of health! And how is Miss McNary? Please give her my best. Oh yes, while thinking about you something just popped into my mind. I have been wanting to tell you about our library. It now has many books--fiction, non-fiction, and reference books. I enjoy going to the library very much but I would still rather go to the S. D. library. / I must go to work now so as much as I hate to I'll say good-bye until I hear from you again. / Most Sincerely, / Louise Ogawa / Ps. There are many rumors going on here and I would like to know if it is true or not. Are vegetables very high now? I heard carrots were 5 c. each. Also lettuce were 25 c. a head. It seems incredable but sacrificing the things we love will certainly help win this war to our favor--United States. / [pencil inscription] / corn 5 c. ea. / carrot 5 c. bnch / lettuce 10 c. head / tom 19 c.-15 c. lb /","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Arcadia, California, June 24, 1942","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"Stretched and framed.  The painting depicts a soldier impaled by a bayonet (still in his chest) on a tree stump, lying in blood.  Dressed in tattered  brown trousers, black combat boots and a canteen at his side, the soldier's body is contorted -- his back arched in pain and his head hangs downward on left; one arm is flung over his head, and one leg is outstretched while the other is bent inward.  He has sage green skin and silver hair with black strands and a well-muscled body.  He appears to either be dead or dying as his face is an expression of agony and pain with his proper left eye closed, proper right eye rolled up nearly in the socket and his mouth, the same shade of red as the blood that runs from his chest is open and appears to be screaming.  The soldier's head and torso lays on a khaki-colored army jacket with three chevron stripes on the sleeve.  Nearby, an upside down helmet lies useless and deserted, bottom right corner.  The background is as grim as the subject in the sky, dark gray clouds are rolling in and the sky is a ghostly pale green.  There appears to be no living creature in the scene except for a few tree stumps.  <br>The painting is rendered in muted tones of red, green and gold -- contributing to its somber tone.  The brush strokes are large and expressive and generally follow the contour of items they depict (e.g. the flowing clouds and the curve of the muscles).  The artist uses a dramatic triangular composition with the soldier's head and torso forming one diagonal, his legs forming the other, and the rifle forming the triangle's apex.  The style of the painting is naturalistic surrealism -- a 20th century art movement in which recognizable scenes are transformed into dreamlike or nightmarish images.",Untitled,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; linen,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.59_a.jpg,"H: 20 in, W: 20 in",27b630152305

"Stretched and framed.  Image of a lone female figure walking away from viewer in a landscape of rows of barracks with Heart Mountain looming in the background.  She has silver hair and  yellow-beige skin.  Dressed in a sleeveless pink dress and gray hat, the woman walks barefoot between two large barracks in foreground in the early dawn indicated by the pale rose and lemony glow of the sky.  She appears to be holding a set of keys in her proper right hand.  Her shadow, a large green misshapen version of her body, looms behind her in left foreground.  The road is flanked by dark gray barracks lined up in regimented rows, some with terra cotta colored chimneys, and recedes into the distance toward the base of the flat-topped mountain.  Her sight appears to be fixated on the grayish-green shape of Heart Mountain.  <br>The artist uses a palette of softly muted colors -- primarily pale salmon pink, olive and khaki greens, maize yellow and gray tinged with lavender.  The scene has an early morning yellow glow.  The composition of the painting is made up of diagonals (the stance of the woman's figure in motion, the roof lines of the buildings in the foreground, the twist of the woman's shadow, and the diagonal lines of linear perspective).  The diagonal composition gives the painting a dynamic and active quality.  The artist also employs a twist on perspective.  The viewer sees the painting from a bird's eye view, and thus views the top of the roofs of the barracks.  Yet the perspective of the buildings fading into the distance makes it appear as if the viewer is located on ground level.  Perhaps the artist's intent in tweaking the perspective was to put the viewer in the mindset of a person who is trapped with nowhere to go.  It is unclear whether the woman is floating above the ground or is anchored firmly to it.  It may be intentional or incomplete.  Painting appears to be unfinished.  Stairs are roughed out but not painted, and some barracks are not outlined -- inconsistency in amount of details shown.  The painting allows the viewer to enter into the psyche of the concentration camp prisoner.  She is anonymous, faceless, yet longing for a world beyond the gray barracks.  She watches the dawns rise above the mountain giving her hope.  The keys that she holds also symbolizes the yearning for freedom.",Untitled,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; linen,http://media.janm.org/collections/janm_2005.3.1_a.jpg,"H: 14.5 in, W: 12 in",ce205bf6d64b
"Stretched and unframed.  Image of a giant hand reaching down from yellow swirling clouds in the sky to grasp a struggling green skinned man with red hair above landscape.  Dressed in an orange shirt and salmon pants, the barefoot man reaches up with his proper right hand to grasp at cloud at right.  Below, a lake of green water is surrounded by dusty pink mountains.  Tiny yellow buildings rest on the edge of the lake and what appears to be barely discernable figures crowd the edge of the painting.  Pale moon rises in background behin a dead and gnarled tree in foreground right.  <br>The painting is structured very dramatically with the diagonal line of the enormous fist and the diagonal line of the writhing man crating an ""x"" in the center of the canvas.  The bright colors of the man and the clouds contrast with the somber darkness of the giant hand.  The style of the painting is naturalistic surrealism -- a 20th century art movement in which recognizable scenes are transformed into dreamlike or nightmarish images.  The painting seems to be an antiwar or anti concentration camp statement.  The man is struggling but he is powerless to fight the giant fist that encloses him.  Although the man writes and claws at the air, he has nowhere to go except into a barren landscape with a dead tree.  The tree, once a living symbol of life and vitality, is a wretched reminder of what once was.  The giant hand is like the hand of God or fate of destiny -- an unstoppable force that has ultimate control over the lives of man.  The tiny people in the background seem to be watching this struggle, but it seems clear that man will not be the victor of his fate.  In the same way that the Japanese Americans were virtually powerless pawns manipulated by the power of the government and entrapped in concentration camps, the man is trapped by powers stronger than himself.  It appears that this painting is a metaphor for the Japanese Americans during World War II.",Untitled,"Okubo, Benji",Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.20A_a.jpg,"H: 14 in, W: 12 in",a14f1606dba5

"2 letters and envelope from Kathrine Tasaki to Helen McNary.  Transcription:<br>Dear Miss McNary, / Thank you very much for the nice letter. / School is so dull I don't enjoy it as much as I did back home. (I'm in the fifth grade.) I sure do wish I could have seen Santa again. / If only I didn't have to come into camp maybe I could be borrowing five books too. / But I sure did learn a lot. And I picked pretty rocks with my girlfriend. And we just have to go under the house. They're very pretty too. But in the mountains there are pretier ones. We just don't think we would care to walk three of four miles. / My mother bought bought me a book, (Mrs. Miniver) a big paint book and she knitted my doll a cap for Chirstmas. / I sure do wish I brought my own paper dolls so that I don't have to play with my girl friend's. But it isn't my fault because when we went to register they told us just to take what we could carry. When we got to the station the red cap took our bags so we could have brought half the house. I was going to bring my ball but I thought it would take up extra space so I didn't bring it. Miss Fay sent me one while we were in Santa Anita but I played with it at night and I lost it so that is my own fault. / I can't think of anything to write so I'll close now. / Yours truly, / Katherine Tasaki / P.S. / My mother has been so busy that she didn't get down to sending ""it,"" but I hope you like your Chirstmas preasant from my mother and I and I am sorry it is so late.  Transcription:<br>I / Dec. 18, 1943 / Poston, Arizona / Dear Miss Mcnary, / Please forgive me for not writing to you for so long. How's S.D.? Guess what? I just learned that at 12:00 tonight we have to turn our clock back one hour. That means California time! / I've written two letters today, so I have to rest now. I will continue this tomorrow. / Dec. 19, 1943 / Here I am again! I just took a pill, and that wasn't any too pleasing. / I've certianly collected a lot of Poston souviners. We kept all the invitations we got, and my mothers friend gave me a Hawaiian doll made out of crepe paper. I wish I could learn how to make things out of crepe paper. But every time I try anything with it, I get the feeling that they will tear. / I can't think of anything to write about. Maybe one of my stories will interest you. I haven't gotten any name for it, but I will leave you to do that. Before I start, let me tell you what gave me the idea. Our teacher told us to write any kind of story we want--provided it's original--but it must start with, ""John and Jack were turning the corner when---."" This is how I went on. / John and Jack were turning the corner when they suddenly came upon a figure slinking away into the shadows. ""Something querr about that fellow."" said Jack. ""Never mind. Right now we have to get home."" The eleven-year-old Henry twins were just coming home from a baseball game in the next town, four miles away. After the game, they had gone to visit an old friend. Having stayed longer than they expected, they missed the last bus. So now we find the twins just getting home. / ""Well, here you are! I was just going out after you!"" said Mr. Henry. ""How was the game?"" John answered, ""Fine sir. We won. If it wasn't for Harry Barnes, we would have lost."" / Harry Barnes was a new boy in town. He had come several months ago, saying he was an orphan. Old Mr. Laurence hired him to work in his drug-store, but when the ""Daleton Tigers"" saw what a swell player he was, they begged Mr. Laurence into giving him afternoons off once in a while to practice. / That night while the boys slept, Jack thought he heard an explosion.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed, + camp Red Cross paper article ""Miss Nance Visits Poston"".  Transcription:<br>December 28, 1943 / Dear Miss Breed, / Thank you ever so much for the many nice presents you sent me. The candy and nuts were delicious. I am in the process of reading the two books you sent, and am enjoying them, especially ""The Tree Toad."" The pin is very cute and looks very nice on my red sweater. I also received a lovely sweater from mom, a purse from sis, and a bath mit, hair ribbons, socks, candy, and a few other things. The giving and receiving at Christmas time is always fun, but we really missed father since my brother was here last Christmas, and there wasn't any menfolk in the house. Many other homes must have missed their menfolks, too. I hope someday soon we may all enjoy ""Peace on Earth, Goodwill Toward Men"" and that many folks may enjoy a really happy reunion. According to letters received here Yuki is spending his five day holiday at my sister's place. It gave mother and me pleasure to think that at least they were having a happy reunion. I believe Minoru Kojima went with my brother, too, as they are roommates, and their family is scattered, too. I hope by next year at least father will be able to join us. / Enclosed with this letter you will find a clipping about Mrs. Nance's visit to Poston. This was in the Red Cross paper which is published here, and is rather battered because the neighbors little got a hold of it before I did and managed to do some fancy scribbling which I haven't yet learned to read. / You may be interested in how we celebrated Christmas. Christmas eve the annual choir singing was held at the stage. The choir sang, and had a pageant. It was very nice, but not as large or well done as last year. This is due primarily to the fact that so many of the leaders have gone out. After that some went to a dance held by ""Greenbays"" a bunch of S.D. boys, while others went to private parties, or just stayed home. We went to a private party. About 10:30 we heard the Church group of about 40 boys and girls making the rounds to each block as they sang various carols. It was beautiful, and more enchanting than the choir singing. I went with them last year through the sand and storm and even later rain, but not this year. We enjoyed our party and went home. / Christmas Day we opened all our presents. After lunch (cabbage [called something terrible that sounds like cabbage] ugh!) Santa (alias Mr. Ouchi) came in and presented gifts to those under 17 and those above 60. These presents to the children were gifts from people back East who were good enough to give them to the children. Candies were given to children with the proceeds of the Bazaar which was held early in December. The older folks received a box of chocolate candies, also from the Bazaar. We (those between 17 and 59) consoled ourselves by telling each other ""we're either too young or too old"" which really is the truth! We're either too young (under 60) and too old (over 17!) Gee, I guess I'll have to add on a couple of 40 years to make the grade, but hope I'll be out of here by then so I could buy my own present! Christmas night we had roast chicked, which was delicious. I felt sick after eating so much so I didn't go to the Blk. 330 dance, though I wanted to go. About 11 p.m. or so there was a fire in Camp 2, which (according to unconfirmed rumor, but which seems true) started at the chicken coop and went on to an empty block (no occupants) and destroyed 6 or so buildings. These buildings were being used to store evacuee furniture, washing machines, refrigerators etc. so it was very costly. However, most people were glad that their inhabited homes were not burned because there they have all their immediate need. It was very windy that night and the whole sky was red. So ended Christmas. / Poston has been very unfortunate in fires. The buildings are made of wood and tar paper, and can easily burn down completely in","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Poston, Arizona, December 28, 1943","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>323-11-D / Poston, Arizona / September 27, 1943 / Dear Miss Breed, / This letter certainly is far overdue, isn't it? I'll have to make myself write oftener. The hardest part of the letter is getting started--after that there's just too much to say. / Saturday night we had a lightning and thunderstorm and the lights went out completely about 8 p.m. By then it was pitch dark except for occasional flashes of lightning. Most people told me they were terrified--but I wasn't. I just pretended that I was camping somewhere (near S.D., of course) and that it had begun to thunder and rain. Of course, our home made me thinking of camping because of the background--cot beds, the rough interior of the house, and crude furniture. I had fun in my imagination and soon went off into a dreamless sleep. / The next morning was extremely cold and a little cloudy, but now it's almost clear. The weather indicates an early winter, I think. We are all wearing sweaters for the first time in some months. We make fun of each other calling: ""sweater girl"" cause they're still rather odd after a hot season. / Yesterday I finished reading ""Lost Horizon."" It really left me with a funny feeling. I was continually amazed by its similarity to this place called Poston. The oddities such as retarding ones growing old, and not being able to breathe easily or rapidly etc. do not apply here. The points that interested me were: (1) the isolation (2) doing everything in moderation (3) the feeling of wanting to go out, and on the other hand, wanting to stay in this leisurely place. / We really have a feeling of isolation here. Of course we have contact with the outside world daily--the newspapers, radio, Sears orders, and mail. Yet, we do not feel the pinch of war acutely nor do we feel it directly. The war is watched yet, we don't feel a part of it--we feel isolated. / Everything is done in moderation as in Shangri-la. Take for example our food--not too good not too poor. Moderation! Or would you call that mediocrity? Nothing here is directly on schedule. If you want something you just have to wait for it, and in due time you will get it. We very rarely feel rushed to do anything except perhaps to catch the bus which leaves every hour for camp 1. / Some feel, as Mallinson in the story, the strong urge to get out--to do things--anything to get out of here. Others, the more aged perhaps, feel strongly that they have no desire to get out. All their lives they've worked hard--and now they are granted food, shelter, and clothing allowance free. They have to work to be entitled to get the clothing allowance, but they work in moderation. I guess this place could be called a second Shangri-la--if you like this type of living. / This book would not have impressed me so strongly if I had read it a few years ago--but now I am continually amazed at the similarity of the two places. Maybe it's my imagination--I don't know. Enough of this kind of talk. / Also read ""Exchange Ship"" by Max Hill about the people (Americans) who were in Japan at the outbreak of war--how they became prisoners, their stay in prison and later their return to America via Asama and Gripsholm as exchange prisoners of war. It was very interesting and we know how they felt and how they were treated. It mention a Miss Alice Grube, who is now working in the Welfare Dept. here. / Have been doing a little bit of crocheting, needlepoint, and knitting besides reading. Been getting tired of this routine and feeling rather bored. Everybody hits these moods sooner or later. / Have to go home now (am writing this in the office) so I will close now. / Please give my best regards to your mother and also Miss McNary. / Always, / Fusa / Sept. 29, 1943 / This letter is still in my box so I'll really have to send it today. / Yesterday I went to camp 1 to see some of the catalogues of approved schools at the student relocation office.

But any way I say it, it still amounts to the same thing--thank you for the paper dolls./A childrens magazine called Play Mate comes in every month at our canteen. I get it every month, and untill recently, I never noticed the section where the children send letters. But its all a different story now. I've answered ten letters that were published in the magazine. I'm pretty satisfied, because from the first three I wrote, I got three nice answers. After that, I wrote the other seven./Really, I never noticed how interesting it was. My mother was born in Oahu, T.H., so I wrote to a girl there, and one in the Canal Zone, at Panama. There were so many from Canada, that it was pretty hard to pick one out, but I did./ Mama says writing ability is a nice thing to have, so I guess if I write a lot of letters, I will get a little ability. But I will have to get a good hand-writing to go with it. I never could write good./Well, it looks like we may be here for the duration, and we may not. There is a stop list, and if you are on that, you can't go unless the government changes its mind./ There are hearings, though, for people on the list. The reason we think we are on the stop list is that we went to Japan between certain years. Two other people on our block had hearings, but they don't know the verdic yet. I bet they're on pins and needles. We can always find out if we are on the list by looking up the names, but my mother doesn't have time. If we are on the stop list, we won't be called for a long time yet, for they are going by the alphabet. I think they are on the r-s by now./ Say ""hello"" to every body for me./Love,/Katherine/P.S./If you happen to see Annie, tell her to write.","Letter to Clara Breed from Katherine Tasaki, Poston, Arizona, January 15, 1944","Tasaki, Katherine",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

I'll put it to use right away./I don't quite know about the candy. It's made from something the Chinese and Japanese eat./I don't know the real reason about my legs. It's just that whenever I walk around 10 minutes, they start hurting at the joints. I've had the doctors look at it, but they don't say anything./I don't miss school too much. Once my teacher sent home our reading and arithmetic books. I made up everything in reading, but I didn't know my group was already at decmal fractions. If I did, I would have studied that too. /At school, we are divided up into groups. There are three arithmetic, and four reading. Naturally, one is the highest. (we go by numbers in arith.) But in reading, D is the highest! It just works backwards./I was very happy when I learned I was still in one-D./My pen-pals have increased a great deal. I have eight now, and I hope to get some more./They are all very nice, and write interesting letters. Not the kind our fifth grade teacher told us to: When we write, just keep on one or two subjects./In the Feb. ""Pic"" magazine, there were some pictures of San Diego. Mostly were women though, because the title was: San Diego--A Women's Town./I saw one picture of a lady that must have been a Yellow Cab driver. Her cap showed that./Another lady had a ""Qaulitee"" cap, and had a basket of milk bottles./There was one picture of some ladys crossing a street. In the background was the Owl Drug. By racking our brains out, we came to the conclusion that it was on fifth and C. where the bus stops./So many people are going out, that this place will be know as a ""ghost"" town. My favorite cousin went out to Chicago, and her brothers going to join her soon. Many people went out from our block because they can go back to Arizona. However, new people come in once in a while, so it isn't such a dreary place./I wish the children wouldn't learn such bad words. The big boys say them, and the little boys learn them. Every thing ""we older children"" do, they pick up. That's why they should get out of here./The hot weather has come back again all of a sudden, and with full force.

Time flies by so fast and it's terribly hard to keep track of. Amazingly enough, I've been here now 2 1/2 months! What's been happening in that time, I just can't say./I can't recall what I told you about my trip so if I repeat myself you'll have to excuse me. We found my father in the best of health and in very good humor. All the men have become jolly and very carefree. The pictures we had of him while he was in Santa Fe showed him to be very wrinkled and old looking, but we were pleased to find him looking almost unchanged except possibly for a little less hair on his head. We told him that, and he replied that he took old-looking pictures so that we would be pleased with the real McCoy. He has something there! I purchased a trunk for a lady (formerly a SD gal) and she seemed very pleased with it. She informed me that the folks are fine and both are happy. I'm very pleased that both pop and mom are fine. Wish they could join us, but that's impossible for the duration, at any rate. Hope to visit them sometime, though. I really miss them./My brother is still in Milwaukee attending Marquette University. So far he hasn't been called, and we're hoping that he can get into Med School all right. He will be graduating in Nov., I believe. Which Med School he will enter is still undecided. He has become quite a student--medicine is his full life-goal and he eats, sleeps, studies and talks medicine. Even though he is my brother, I'm quite proud of him and respect him for what he is and hopes to be. I'm glad he has the ambition and will to be something better than just a workingman. He will have lots of hardships but he'll come up through all well, I know./My sister Fuji and brother-in-law Bill had a nice week's vacation in Cincinnati with some of their friends. Yours truly stayed with some girl friends, and then invited them over for a while. The week really passed fast. Both Bill and Foo came back refreshed mentally but physically exhausted from the hectic trainride. Their trip was quite hard on their pocketbook but well worth it as they had a wonderful time. Although we should not travel, I believe that it's OK for the sake of the morale as we're doing our part, though small, in the war effort./I was quite surprised and pleased to learn that Aiko Kubo is planning to go to Hameline University. About a month ago I had the pleasure of staying over the week-end with Ikuko Kuratomi (formerly S.D.) at Hewett's lodge. She is attending Hameline and studying to be a Medical Technician. We walked on the campus and she told me about it. It's very old, not too expensive, and has a nice college atmosphere. The school is small and students get to know each other as most of them live on the campus or nearby. /What a pleasant surprise to learn that Miss McNary is now Mrs. Gilliland! I can picture her as a wonderful housekeeper but it's hard to imagine her with more weight on her! Please express my congratulations to her!/How are you and the help situation now? Have you found a nice capable person to help you? Have you taken your vacation yet?/Oh yes, while at Ikuko's place I saw a magazine published at U.C. at Berkeley which had exerpts of letters to your sister from the young niseis who have relocated at various places and schools. Was pleased to find an excerpt from Ikuko's letters and also my brother's! I had to laugh, though at what my brother said--rather at the way he said what he did. He loves big words and used a whole string of 25 c. words just to say that people in Milwaukee had been very receptive and do not seem to even notice them. Did you see that particular issue? It's an old issue, but Ikuko had it./Am planning to take some pictures soon, and will be glad to send you one when I get it developed. May I have one of you?

Everyone was overwhelmed with joy when we saw the iron. I have been wondering all night how I can put in words my gratitude. And I always seem to end up by saying ""Thank You."" I hope in the near future I will be able to show how much I appreciate everything you have done for me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank You! / I ironed with it last night and it works beautifully. I wanted to write you as soon as I received the iron but I thought it best to wait until I received your letter. I hope you will include every penny you spent to purchase the iron. Poston seems to be still the same hot, susty place. With the heavy rainfall we had the other week, the grounds have become a little harder, and the wild grasses seem to have grown a little thicker, to my father's disgust. / As I recall, you asked in your last letter if I applied for leave. Well, I have not as yet. But to my surprise, my Eastern Defense Clearance Papers came the other day. The thing that was so surprising was that I didn't even apply for it. At the present time, I am trying awfully hard to convince my father that I should go out, but he feels that I should wait a little while. He believes I am too young, in mind if not in age. But at the rate I am pestering him, he'll give in sooner or later, unless his patience holds out! I talk to him so that he says he even dreams of me talking to him of going out. I can just about imagine how he finally said yes, in his dream of course, but this doesn't satisfy me cause it was not in reality. But just you wait and see, I'll be writing soon saying ""I'm finally going out Miss Breed!"" Oh what happy days that will be. But on the other hand, the thought of leaving my father leaves me hesitant. / School is scheduled to commence September 20th. Everyone in the office is left very busy with registration etc. The office is still being remodeled but hope it will be finished very soon. / Tonight's movie is going to be ""Take A Letter, Darling."" I am very anxious to see it since I have heard so much about it. / One of my girl friends relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, and she wrote and said that she just couldn't get use to the indoor theaters. In Poston the movies are shown outdoors, under the stars. She kept looking up at the ceiling thinking she would see the stars. While waiting for the movie to begin, everyone looks up at the sky trying to find the Big Dipper etc. (This is in Poston of couse.) I can imagine how much she enjoyed the picture sitting in the soft-cushioned chairs. / I never thought I would have friends in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Colorado, Arkansas, Utah, Idaho, or Wyoming; but I do now! / One of these days, I'll be traveling all over the United States just visiting friends. I think that'll be such fun! / September 5, 1943 / <br>Hello Miss Breed! / Well, here I am again! I thought I'd wait a few days for your letter but not a day longer, so off this letter will go. / I know you are very busy but I do hope you will write very soon and inform me of the amount (total) I owe you. / ""Take A Letter Darling"" certainly was an enjoyable comedy! It kept us laughing all through the picture. / Well, Miss Breed I have finally joined the Poston Indian tribe. I imagine it'll take you centuries to join this tribe!

I kept reading deep into the night not being able to stop. Well, finally by force I stopped./The story stayed on my mind all during the night. I kept thinking how important water played in their lives in Denver--using the same water for bathing, washing clothes and floors. Then the puzzling question--who did all the gorgeous jewelry belong to. My but I was in a tangle--that was because I wasn't able to finish it like I wanted it. This book is keeping me in suspense just like ""Felicity Way."" That was such a exciting book!! Thank you for everything, Miss Breed!! Thank you./In my last letter I said I enclosed a school paper--well, I plum forgot about it. Before I become a liar I am sending it. Here it is!!!/I imagine you have heard by now how hot it is here in Poston. Though it is only March it feels like the middle of July. I am roasting and my skin is being toasted in Poston. The temperature has been somewhere in the 90's. Oh my, I hate to meet up with the sun in June!/I imagine San Diego is still as cool as a cucumber. At this very moment, I feel as cool as the Boston baked beans. I reason why I mention the Boston baked beans is because I just saw a plate of steaming, delicious looking Boston baked beans in an advertisement./Oh yes, I had my picture taken last week--no, not alone. It was a group picture-core studies class. Mr. Stone Ishimaru, the official photographer of Poston, took the pictures. He is leaving soon for he has joined the armed forces. I understand we will be able to purchase some later. I shall send you one if it comes out good. I probably broke the camera./Miss Breed, the dinner bell rang and it slipped my mind.

Transcription:<br>October 30, 1943/En route to Newell, California/just past Bakersfield -- (writing may be bad as our ride)/Dear Miss Breed,/I still can't quite believe it but I am now in California. Of course I am not ""free to wander anywhere I please,"" but I am in California. Volunteers were called to save the W.R.A. vegetable crop at Tule Lake. This time I was not rejected because of my arm although the doctor gave me some anxious moments. Again as in the last call for Combat Team volunteers, San Diegans again head the list in the number of responses as compared with any other locality represented in Poston I, II, III./It is about 1:45 PM PWT we expect to arrive in Stocton about 7:00 PM. We haven't been nor allowed out of our coach until we arrive at destination! We boarded the coach in Parker at 11:35 PM MWT and a few minutes later gazed at the mighty Colorado River beneath us as we crossed into California. By the way I think I mentioned that our contract calls for work until Dec 15 unless terminated sooner by freezing weather. It will be my first time in snow country. Well for that matter it will be my first time north of Los Angeles./We arrived in Barstow at 6:00 AM PWT where we had box lunch right out of a refrigerator for breakfast. The trip all the way to Tehachapi was tiresomely uneventful. However from there on the huge mountain range with its cloud tipped peaks was a breathtaking sight. (We just pulled into Corcoran 2:05 PM PWT) Went through a lot of tunnels, something I hadn't done in a long time. Around noon the oil derricks of Bakersfield came into sight. Reminds me of the coast oil fields. After getting used to the Poston heat I find it rather cool out here in Central California. The nights are downright cold./<br>Yaeko is now in Preston, Idaho working as a dishwasher in a small restaurant. She is contemplating indefinite leave. /Dad should be arriving in Poston within the next two weeks. He will be disappointed in not having any members of the family to greet him home./Well there isn't much else. Address is unknown as yet. One thing certain is that we will not be allowed in the Tule Lake Center but will live 3 1/2 miles from it./Sincerely yours/Ted","Letter to Clara Breed from Tetsuzo (Ted) Hirasaki, Stockton, California, October 30, 1943","Hirasaki, Tetsuzo",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>Blk. 323-11-D/Poston, Arizona/July 21, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/Thank you ever so much for sending the books which I received yesterday. As yet I have not finished any of them, but they all look very enticing. Your choice in reading matter at this time could not have been more appropriate. Vocational training especially during wartime is something to think about. Chiyo and I have been seriously considering this matter for some weeks and were having a hard time trying to figure out which is the right thing to do. She has been thinking about taking window display or fashion designing or going into secretarial training. We have been trying to figure out which line would be most practical and which she would get the most enjoyment out of. We see the secretarial jobs as most practically financially as she would like to have her brother get some college education if possible later, yet she would get most enjoyment out of window designing or fashion designing. We have also been tring to figure out whether such jobs would be open to us and effects after the war (or are we looking too far into the future?). Well, what I meant to say is your books really came in a very convenient time./My sister, as well as Chiyo's relatives who are living in Chicago, all advise that we know typing and shorthand. They are all very frank and tell us to have some specialized skilled before going outside if we expect to live decently. Yet we face the situation of being unable to get the much needed education. One of the most difficult things to do here is to actually get down and study. We all try, but the atmosphere (should I say surroundings) are so disheartening it's extremely difficult to keep it up. Since these latest letters I've resumed my attempt at learning short hand (a la homestudy) but I wonder how long I will be able to keep it up. I'll try harder this time./In my last letter I forgot to tell you what to get with the remaining 70 c. I've thought of a million different things, but finally decided on these items: (1) the August issue of Mademoiselle price 35 c. (about) (2) hook and eyes [2 packages] and snaps [2 packages] total 20 c. (about again!) That's about all I guess--but the assignment is rather tough isn't it? The August issue of Mademoiselle is strictly for my own morale--I love to look and wish for the beautiful college clothes. The other is for others morals--they know zippers are hard to get so we're keeping ourselves together somehow!/It has been very hot lately but since we have our cooler all hooked together now we manage to feel the heat less. It keeps our place about ten to 15o cooler than the outside so we don't mind the heat too much. Most of us are surprised that it is as cool as it is this year for we were told that it is unbearably hot here--but we've lived through hot and cold now without a cooler and don't find it too bad. I do know, though that I prefer living in cool places rather than hot places. Hot weather makes us all too lazy. I guess yours truly is about the laziest thing around here!/Some of the younger children have been going out to the Mesquite trees and picking locusts. They bring them back and do they make a lot of noise. They sound like the neon lights in the city that keep buzzing and saying that they need fixing. They also sound like the first electric shaving outfits. Since the crickets have calmed down in their nightly serenades the locusts are beginning on their jive sessions!/The girls of our block challenged some of the younger fellows in our block to a game of softball. We all had fun making many many errors. I played catcher. This was the first time any form of exercise was done by me (other than walking) for more than a month--so my leg muscles went on strike and pulled together so hard that I can barely walk. It's torture trying to sit and stand. I'll get over it soon, but at the present time they really bother me.

Tomorrow, June 20th, is Vesper./I imagine I won't be writing for quite some time because I will be so busy.

Tomorrow morning go to church; in the afternoon go to the church and help decorate for the evening Vesper Service. Then I am in charge of the party after commencement. So I am always flying all over Poston III asking about this and that = so much red tape./We are quite doubtful about the River Party because of the Dies Committee. They are in camp now. I am enclosing a copy of the Senior Week activities. I hope you will enjoy reading it./We are planning to hold commencement at the amphitheater. As yet it is not constructed, but we are praying that it will be by graduation. I shall write just as soon as I can talking about everything we did./At the present time a swimming pool and amphitheater is under construction. A civic center is being planned. They are also planning to construct a bowling alley and an outdoor dance pavillion./I haven't seen hide nor hair of those senior's individual snap-shots that I spoke about some time ago. I am growing very impatient./I am planning to take a secretarial position in the school office after graduation. Yesterday the girl whose position I am going to secure was ill so I took her place. I had to take my first dictation. I was so nervous I could hardly write. I just couldn't stop my fingers from shaking./I have heard that San Diego is divided into sections. - Is this because of the increased population?/My girl friend in San Diego wrote and said no more silk or rayon stockings are available. Right after the war broke out many ladies bought dozens of stockings and I laughed, but now I envy them./I understand that only one trunk has survived the fire at the Buddhist Church.

Transcription:<br>Blk. 323-11-D/Poston, Arizona/June 27, 1943/Dear Miss Breed,/Thank you very much for sending me the letter, clipping on the N.Y.A., and cross word puzzles. Some of those puzzles are mighty confusing. I noticed on top of the N.Y.A. clipping that Etta Kett still manages to go out with fellows on automobiles on dates despite gas rationing and also tire rationing. She must have what it takes--or is that only in the comic strips?/Tetsuo explained to me why you were unable to come to visit us. We realize--""business before pleasure"" is just one of those unavoidable things. From your accounts of your vacation you really had a good time despite some of the hectic moments. Nowadays vacation must mean doing anything out of the ordinary, then going back to work for a rest! For us one of the hardest things for us to realize is that every moment counts on the outside--in here one day is the same as the rest and no one is in a hurry to get anywhere./My sister is in Minneapolis, Minnesota with her husband doing domestic work. She says they don't like the work, so they have given notice to quit. After the 30th they will move elsewhere in Minn. Jobs are plentiful there, but the housing situation seems to be acute as in other cities. They are planning  to rent an apartment with another couple. She says for me to stick around here for a while longer until they get settled. However, with more and more people leaving it leaves me feeling restless with an urge to go out. <br>/My brother, Yuki, is now working on a farm in Milwaukee. Due to some tie up with the Federal Reserve Banks he hasn't been able to withdraw the money which was to keep him in school. He is planning to work until about Nov., then enter school again. He claims that to become a doctor (a full fledged M.D.) is an ""obsession"" with him and he will attain his goal regardless of the amount of years and amount of work he has to do. Mother was worried for fear that after he started working he would not care to go back to school, but now has been rather assured by him that it will not be so. I'm glad for his sake that he plans to become something of value to mankind. I hope and pray that he will make a fine doctor someday./I can't imagine what you mean by ""the rest of the week---was foggy and cold----and we had to wear coats and suits most of the time."" That to me would be paradise! We roast in this hot sun all day and can't sleep until after ten!/The crickets are in their full glory. They get into our clothes and mostly on our nerves. If they would only get together and make some decent melody! They jump like grasshoppers and scare me more that I scare them when I try to catch them. /<br>Does your sister still correspond with many of us nisei's or is she too busy right now? /Well, Miss Breed, don't work too hard. Let me hear from you soon./Sincerely,/Fusa Tsumagari","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Poston, Arizona, June 29, 1943","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>323-11-D / Poston, Ariz. / May 3, 1943 / Dear Miss Breed, / According to Tets, you have been trying to come to Poston, and have been having to go through a lot of red tape. If that is true, I'd like to help you get here without so much bother. I understand that if we put in an application for you, you can come in any time. If you would let me know the date you would like to come, I could try to arrange it for you. You haven't given up trying to come have you? One thing you should prepare for, in the event that you come, is the HEAT! We've been hitting over 100 in the house for the last two weeks. It certainly makes one rush around early in the morning, and then ""take it easy"" all afternoon. It's almost impossible to do anything but sleep in the afternoon. / I have been trying to get some things through various catalogues, but it seems as though the only way we can get certain items is to go shopping on the spot. I wonder if you could get two things for us. One is an umbrella for me. Any dark shade will do, my first choice is blue print, my second brown. I believe they cost about $2.00. The other is a gallon thermos jug, costing about $2.50. I would prefer it to have a spigot or faucet, but if there aren't any, any kind will do. Enclosed is $5 which should cover the cost. We hope it isn't too much trouble for you, but as it is impossible for us to go right into town, we certainly would appreciate your getting them for us. / My sister has gone out to Minneapolis to work, with her husband. He is doing farm work and she is taking care of some twins. They don't like the work too well, but are going to stick it out for a while until something better turns up. / Tomorrow more of my friends are leaving for Chicago for work of some kind. This leaves me with an empty feeling of wanting to go outside, yet without a definite place to go. It's really tough on people my age who have just gotten out of high school without any specific training. We want to go out and work, but we haven't had enough training or experience and feel rather unsure of ourselves. However, I guess everyone feels this way when they grow up and have to face the world. Our problems are just like anyone else except for the fact that we have to get out of camp first of all. That's more and more red tape just to get out. Everyday we see ads for work outside. Lots of girls take domestic work just to get outside, then they plan to move into some other line of work. I, myself, don't like domestic work and have been told that it isn't the best line of work to go into, even as a starter. I can amble on and on on this subject but it won't get us anywhere so this is enough of my troubles. / You people must be having a terrible time with all this point system and rationing. We really don't have the slightest idea about it because it doesn't affect us directly. All of it is handled through various other channels. / Please give your mother and Miss McNary our best regards. Please tell Miss McNary that I mean to write to her, but my correspondence is so terrible that I'm just swamped with unanswered letters all the time. / Thanks ever so much for the trouble of getting those things for me. / Sincerely, / Fusa","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Poston, Arizona, May 3, 1943","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>April 5, 1944/Dear Miss Breed,/This will probably be my last letter written to you from the fair city of Poston, Arizona. When I think of the good times (and some miserable times) I've spent in Poston I feel sort of sad, yet glad to be on my way. My mother is going to join my father in Crystal City, Texas, an internment camp. I am going with my mother to Crystal City, but will go as a visitor (for about two weeks) then go to Minneapolis to join my sister. According to the latest information, we will leave on or about the 12th. Incidentally we were notified very early, so have been packed for over a week. The house looks very bare except for one corner, which has piles of crated boxes. No one seems to know how we've accumulated so much junk in two years! The last group that left for Crystal City had from 3 days to 24 hour notice so everyone thought we would leave in that short of a time, but no luck! I was fortunate, however, in being able to get part of my transportation paid g.i. plus cash grant. Under ordinary circumstances we are allowed $25 cash grant, $3 a day for meals and a ticket to our destination by the most direct route--this is for an indefinite leave. In my case, I would not be able to get my transportation paid as I would not be on the most direct route except for a few miles, so arrangements were made so that the govt would issue my ticket from Crystal City to Minneapolis. I was very lucky to even get this as other people have tried to get their tickets made like mine, but have not succeeded./My mother will probably be happy and greatly relieved to be with father. I'm quite anxious to see him, too, as it is now almost 2 1/2 years since we last saw him. I imagine that he hasn't changed very much in the two years, but I think he'll probably be surprised at how grown up I've become (or have I?)/Crystal City, according to various letters we received, is a very wonderful place. It is quite an improvement over Poston. The buildings are white (not this black tar paper), each family cooks for themself, have a shower in each barrack to be shared by the families occupying the barrack, well furnished, and nice canteen. So much is allowed per person per day for food and this amount is given them in certain coins only good at the local store, and they tell us food is ample. I shall tell you about my experience there after I have left, as we are limited to send out only 2 censored letters a week.--Must admit Crystal City does have its bad point, too!/Poston has become very hot in the last week. We are really feeling first touch of summer. All the little leaves are getting big and green. The mesquites in the background are showing off their first bright kelly green leaves--only then do we realize that spring is here. We think that spring doesn't come to Poston--just summer!/There is only one thing I regret--that is your being unable to visit Poston while I was here. I would have been glad to show you around, but now I'll have to leave it to Margaret and some of the other girls and boys. /My new address will be--2625 Stevens Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota. If there is anyone you know I would be glad to see them for you. /Oh yes, Chiyo Kusumoto left for Chicago last March 1 and seems to like it. /This will be all for now and thanks a million for everything you've done for us in S.D., S.A., and P, A./Sincerely,/Fusa","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Poston, Arizona, April 5, 1944","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Fusa Tsumagari to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>Jan 27, 1944/Dear Miss Breed,/It was extremely thoughtful of you to send us the two boxes of clothing. We certainly can make good use of them. I was quite surprised to see two boxes and a letter awaiting me when I came home from work. Thank you very much./I intended to write to you much sooner than this, but old man flu caught up with me. First mother got it, then about a week later I got it. Just about everyone in our neighborhood has had a touch of it./It is raining outside and the cold damp air makes us feel really alive for a change. Since we now have gravel in our block in front of the barracks we don't have to worry about slushing about in the mud. When we first got here it was really terrible, but now there is gravel and asphalted roads which help a great deal./Today Mr. Duncan Mills, our new project director and Mr. Dillon Myers of the W.R.A. arrived and are being given a royal welcome. I don't know the cause of Mr. Head, our former director's, retirement. All that ever came into contact with him tell us that he's a very understanding and admirable person./I'm glad you liked the doll I sent you, although I'll have to confess I didn't make it. It is a handmade doll, but not by my hands. I enjoy doing that type of thing, but somehow I don't have the artistic touch and the faces never never come out halfway decent. You've named the doll by now, haven't you? If you haven't I thought PADDY might be cute. This is the way I figure it out:/P is for Poston/A ""   ""    Arizona/D ""   ""    dolly/DY are so she'll have a girlish ending. What do you think of that? Or have you already given her a name? (Oh yes, she's well padded, too!)/I've been trying to give myself an American name, but try as I do, I don't seem to be able to find a suitable one. The only one that appeals a little bit is Jan. I want a short name, but not harsh sounding. Some gals call me Mabel--and I answer to it, but I don't like that name. Maybe you can help me pick a name otherwise I'll have to keep calling myself nameless!/I just finished reading ""The Human Comedy"" by Saroyan and enjoyed it very much. There is a big lesson of happiness in there for us./ Thank you, once again for sending the boxes. We really will see that they are used to best advantage. Thanks also for the dolls bobbie pins, etc other nicknacks./Please take good care of yourself and mother./Sincerely/Fusa","Letter to Clara Breed from Fusa Tsumagari, Poston, Arizona, January 27, 1944","Tsumagari, Fusa",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Katherine Tasaki to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>3/16-44/Poston, Ariz./Dear Miss Breed,/How will I do it? Do what? Why, thank you, of course. For what? For the simply splendid books, naturally. Every single one is almost as dear as you are, but not quite. But for books, they're the best ever./Well, I haven't even started my book yet, but I wrote a few articles and children's short stories. I figure that's better than just coming out and write a book, all of a sudden./Miss Breed, did you ever have trouble in the 6th grade? But I guess mine are pretty silly. My worst are the boy's in our class. I never saw such roughnecks--and I'm sure out teacher hasn't either./My other trouble is the blackboard. Every time I'm asked to write in front of the class, I get the jitters. Making a report is much easier./I certainly do go off and on a subject, don't I? The girls in our room have started a club called the Dramatic Damsels--Dee Dee. We have appointed different committees, and I was chosen for one of the play writers. That's quite an honor./I had an idea for a play, but it was a perfectly impossible one. Three reasons make it very hard for me to think. It has to be our own, it has to be about Norway, Sweden, or Denmark, and I was absent for so long that I didn't get much information on either of those countries. But I'm determined to write a play. I just feel like writing./We had a swell sand storm day before yesterday. Yes sir! Arizona is the place for a sand company./With the opening of the new audotorium, every thing is happening. Almost every night there's a play or show. And the stage certainly reminds me of the audotorium back home. /Today is my lucky day. Besides receiving your books, our trunk came, and we had two square meals./Our cook is so cock-eyed, we feel like throwing the food at him sometimes./Everybody seems to be dying all of a sudden. My mother's make-believe mother, the baby of a friend of ours in Arkansas, and my teacher's grandmother all died in March. /Summer started coming all of a sudden, and as suddenly changed its mind. I hear California had some cold weather, too./My father says the natives of Detroit all agree that this year was a very mild winter, but he doesn't think so./I'm pretty proud of my library record. The one at the school doesn't have any blotches, and the public library has only one over-due mark. Of course, there are a few who don't have any over-dues in our room, but they all lost at least one card. And I'm already on my third one./Pen Pals are lot's of fun. I have 20 right now, and every single one is swell. Especially our club. There are 3 others besides me. I feel flattered that I was asked to join, and I happen to be the youngest one--also the silliest./One night my mother and I went to a play given by the high school. The title was ""What a Life,"" an episode from the life of Henry Aldriech./Have you heard of the Pacific Citizen? My father wants it, so we buy and read it every week. I have noticed that Poston and San Diego are used often./I've run out of news now, so will close. But not without thanking you again for the books./Love,/Katherine","Letter to Clara Breed from Katherine Tasaki, Poston, Arizona, March 16, 1944","Tasaki, Katherine",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>July 14, 1944/Dear Miss Breed, /The popular song ""Long ago and far away"" seems to be appropriate for my . It certainly has been a long long time since I last wrote. I don't know if it's the weather or me but every time I start to write a letter I never seem to finish it and the letter becomes ""stale"" so in it goes into the waste paper basket and never into the mail box. This time I hope to send this letter to you for sure. /I do hope you are in the very best of health! Here in Poston we are all just fine trying to get away from the heat. I thought for a minute we were going to have a very cool summer and I admit it has been quite cool compared to last year but it's getting very hot now! I guess this would never be Poston without the heat! How is the weather in San Diego? Whenever I think of the summer months back in San Diego, I recall the days we spent at the beach, park, and the zoo. Oh, it was so nice!! I wish I could do it all over again./ The wading pool for the little children has finally been completed and you will find little children playing in the water all day long. There is a fine view from the window of the school office and while I stand watching them it makes me so envious./It must be this heat that makes us all feel so lazy but one thing I still can do is argue. I think pretty soon my folks are going to get so tired of arguing with me that they will shue me out./Speaking of the draft problem--quite a number of boys are being called for the army and together with the relocation this camp is slowly becoming empty. There are quite a number of boys refusing to appear for induction. I just can't imagine young boys just out of school being picked up by the F.B.I. and taken to jail. It just doesn't seem right. For the boys, I know, it is a very delicate problem but I would much rather see them go into the army instead of to jail. I think it is a pity to see such fine young sturdy boys fresh out of high school not yet knowing what life really is being put behind bars separated from the rest of the world. Maybe I am too Americanized to see their view point but on the other hand I know I should respect them for their decision and determination to carry out what they believe should be./Please give my very best regards to Miss McNary and do write when time permits. I just love to hear about your work and the library, the rapidly changing San Diego--your letters are so full of interesting things./Most respectfully,/Louise Ogawa","Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, July 14, 1944","Ogawa, Louise",Gift of Elizabeth Y.

I received your letter informing me of your intentions of being in Chicago. By the time it reached me, it was too late to write so I dropped you a hurried note in care of Miss Batchelder. She informed me by mail that your plans had been changed. It would have been wonderful to see you again! I hope someday soon our path may cross./<br>Yes, Chicago is certainly a large city. It seems like a world all by itself! It's a wonderful feeling to be able to walk the streets side by side with all creeds of people again! I never dreamed I would ever relocate but here I am. I know I shall gain much through my experiences in Poston and here in Chicago./I am rooming with two girl friends. Kikuye Kawamoto, one of the twins, and I came out to Chicago together. Another girl friend formerly from Visalia, California is staying with us. We share a four room apartment. It's very nice. The location is very convenient for the Jackson bus stops right in front of our apt. It takes us a good 30 minutes to get to our place of employment. We transfer twice on the streetcar. We, Kikuye and I, are emploted at A.C. McCluy &amp; Co. We are doing office work. Kikuye works in the Library Division and I in the  Dept. We like our work very much./The business center of Chicago, ""the loop"" certainly is a busy section isn't it. After going in and out of several stores, we often lose our sense of direction. We found apt. hunting very difficult. It was like hunting for a needle in the hay stack. We looked for one week continuously before one was found./We haven't done much in the way of entertainment or sight seeing for we are more interested in getting settled at our new home. Some friends have come visiting but as yet we have not gone. Have you heard from Hisako Watanabe? She relocated to Cleveland, Ohio about two weeks before I did. She is at present doing domestic work./Margaret Ishino is still in Poston. After living like sisters since we were knee-high, I certainly miss her. I hope she will be able to relocate soon too!/Chicago certainly is a windy city. It's quite chilly here. I think I'm going to like the winter.

"1 letter from Katherine Tasaki to Helen McNary.  Transcription:<br>January 6, 1944/Poston, Ariz./Dear Miss McNary,/I'm sorry it took me so long to write to you. Thank you for the card. I got it on Christmas Day./I suppose the library is just as busy as ever. I've spoiled my perfect record, by being overdue two times. I'm probly going to have to pay again this time too. My mother has to work, so she can't take them, and I haven't been up very often lately./Anyway, I don't have to go to the public library now, because I have 45 books! I'll have 51 pretty soon (I hope) because my mother ordered me some./ If our trunk comes soon (if it comes at all) I will get my 10 c. rings, necklaces, etc., and my mother will get her shoes! You know, they're very precious. Her dresses (my mother's) are in there too. What she needs most of all is the black dress./ Did you see the article Miss Breed wrote for the Horn book? I thought it was grand. Especially where a little girl's name is mentioned./ I imagine San Diego is just as busy as ever. My mother and I both wish we could go back. We're always saying to each other ""Remember when we _____."" or ""Remember back home _____."" We always say ""back home"" when we mean S.D./Hoping to hear from you soon./Love/Katherine","Letter to Helen McNary from Katherine Tasaki, Poston, Arizona, January 6, 1944","Tasaki, Katherine",Gift of Elizabeth Y.
