Indeed, as a major player in a spoils system that reduced the civil service to a vehicle for rewarding party faithful, he struck many as an emblem of all that was wrong in American politics. As president, however, Arthur rose above his past to promote landmark legislation designed to curb the spoils system. He also proved to be a foe of other forms of corruption. When, for example, a ""pork barrel"" bill for public improvements reached his desk, he vetoed it.  This head-and-shoulders portrait can only hint at the fashionable figure that Arthur cut. With his muttonchop whiskers ""trimmed to the perfection point"" and his suits made of only the finest fabrics, he invariably looked like the very epitome of the well-bred Victorian gentleman.

Adhering to his ""dymaxion"" principle, which called for maximum results from a minimum of material and energy, he was an early advocate of prefabrication and modular construction. The most famous of Fuller's achievements was the geodesic dome, which artist Boris Artzybasheff wittily depicts here as the structure of Fuller's face and skull. Patented in 1947, this spherical structure required no internal support, thus creating an unobstructed interior space. In 1967, one of Fuller's domes served as the United States pavilion at the world exposition in Montreal, where it became a symbol of America's tradition in technical innovation.

As a mining engineer, he had turned marginal operations into thriving enterprises. During World War I, his administration of European food relief was nothing short of brilliant. As secretary of commerce in the 1920s, he transformed a once-sleepy department into a purposeful information clearinghouse. But as the Great Depression took hold during the second year of his presidency, Hoover was hard pressed for a solution. Believing in the power of private initiative, he hesitated to involve the federal government in reviving business. When lengthening bread lines and escalating joblessness finally convinced him of the necessity of such steps, the measures proved inadequate. As a result, Hoover was defeated by a crushing margin in his 1932 reelection bid. This portrait was intended for Time magazine's cover. But Hoover delayed his sittings, and by the time it was finished, the magazine was no longer interested. Hoover is thus the only president in Time's history never to appear on a cover while in office.

Jefferson appears younger than his fifty years, perhaps evoking the young man the artist remembered as the Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress. Jefferson was well known to Americans in 1791, having also served as governor of Virginia and ambassador to France. Notwithstanding George Washington's desire for unity in his administration, Jefferson quickly found himself at odds with Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, whose power and influence on the president rivaled his own. Jefferson favored a smaller, weaker national government, with more power residing in the states, and closer ties to France; Hamilton argued for a powerful national government allied to Great Britain.

Great Britain, with its naval superiority, forbade American ships from supplying Napoleon闂佺偨鍎查悰?armies and forced American sailors to serve in its navy (impressment).

This reaper was a first step in the mechanization of American agriculture, allowing the efficient cultivation of large tracts of farmland by small numbers of farmers. This industrialization of the land allowed the United States to boost agricultural production to unprecedented levels and to feed growing cities and industrial towns. McCormick's design was pirated by competitors, but he overcame his rivals by founding his own factory outside Chicago in 1847. There, he contributed to the pace of industrial growth by using standardized parts and assembly-line production-methods that had been pioneered by Samuel Colt and others.

Everyone, it seemed, wanted the hero's portrait. But it is this portrait that stands for all time as the image that best represents what Washington meant to us when we were a new nation and continues to mean to us in the twenty-first century. It is the one picture that we can say ranks in importance with those sacred founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 	We see Washington in 1796, the last year of his two-term presidency. Earlier full-length portraits show him in military uniform, but here he is in civilian dress, revealing that in our democracy the elected executive is the true commander-in-chief. Standing in elegant surroundings suggesting the grandeur of European tradition, Washington is nonetheless not draped like a king, which he refused to be; he is a man powerful only by the people's consent. This was the man who told us what this new kind of leader-an elected president-could be and whose maturity and resolve gave us confidence in our future. The rainbow behind him breaks through a stormy sky. 	Washington was lucky in his portraitist, and so are we. American-born Gilbert Stuart had eighteen years in Europe to hone his artistry. He was commissioned by Senator and Mrs. William Bingham of Pennsylvania to provide a gift to the Marquis of Lansdowne, an English supporter of American independence.

Wilson-two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction-has been a leader of the biodiversity movement since the 1980s. Trained as an entomologist specializing in ant biology, Wilson has ranged from New Guinea and Sri Lanka to the Smithsonian Institution for his work. His groundbreaking Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975) was a controversial study that examined the biological basis of social behavior in all kinds of organisms, including vertebrates, with links to evolutionary biology. A hallmark of his later work has been an attempt to bridge the gap between science and the culture at large, as in Consilience: The Unity of Life (1998).  	Artist Jennie Summerall posed Wilson in a setting reminiscent of the landscape on Lignum Vitae Key in Florida, which he helped preserve.

Stationed in the Southwest, Taylor had anticipated war, and when conflict broke out with Mexico he was able to quickly cross the Rio Grande in a campaign that culminated in the defeat of General Santa Anna at Buena Vista in 1847. This painting shows Taylor with his staff at Walnut Creek, Texas, just as hostilities broke out. The Polk administration distrusted Taylor, an outspoken Whig, fearing he would use his military career for political ends. But they could not deny the appeal of a victorious general, and Taylor was elected president in 1849 as a symbol of national unity. Sectional differences over slavery were proving intractable, however, and Taylor had a short, unhappy term as president, dying amid negotiations over the Compromise of 1850.
