Posey traced the gymnasts on this quilt from a pantyhose advertisement; she copied the central figure in a coat from another advertisement. She learned to quilt from her grandmother, a former slave, and continued to quilt throughout her life. She remembered that during her childhood piecing and quilting were community activities.
