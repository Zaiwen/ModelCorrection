(International Exhibition of Modern Art). uBellows was associated with the Ashcan School, a group of painters in New York City who celebrated everyday subject matter in paintings of the urban scene. His energetic style and broad brushwork won immediate praise and recognition, and at the age of 27, he was elected as one of the youngest associates in the history of the National Academy of Design. Four years later, in 1913, he became an academician and exhibited in New York's landmark Armory Show , His exposure there to modern European art is evident in the heightened color, and concern for form and structure, seen in Portrait of Florence Pierce . The dramatic lighting and loose paint handling, especially beautiful in the sitter's foreshortened arm and hand draped over the chair back, are characteristic of the powerful, realistic portraits that Bellows painted throughout his career.",

Indian Pass Scholars have long proclaimed Cole the \"father\" of the first native school of American painting. Dubbed the Hudson River School, the movement is perhaps more accurately described as the American branch of 19th-century Romantic landscape painting. A British-born American transplant, Cole created a distinct niche for American scenery by isolating its constituent parts: majestic mountains, brilliant skies, abundant wilderness, flowing rivers, and flaming autumn trees, all of which he celebrates in . In this classic Hudson River School landscape, sunlight illuminates a glorious wilderness scene, filled with fallen branches, lichen-covered woods, and framing trees that give way to a towering mountain that pierces passing clouds. In the foreground, blasted trees suggest the inevitable passage of time while the Native American figure, bow in hand, introduces a nostalgic element; by 1847, when this work was painted, Native Americans no longer inhabited the scenic wilderness Cole depicts. By combining these elements with a lush, dramatic setting, Cole offered 19th-century viewers a marker by which to measure the nation's past, present, and future.",

Her alert pose, intense gaze, and upper-body posture contrast with the seemingly relaxed position of her lower body, an instance of how Sargent seemed to capture, as one critic wrote, \"the nervous tension of the age.\" Sears played an important role in a number of artists' careers by buying their works and providing additional support. Together with her friend, and often rival, art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner, Sears served as a preeminent Boston tastemaker at the turn of the 20th century. In addition, Sears was an accomplished painter and photographer who exhibited her work in important international exhibitions such as the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago and the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo, New York. In this painting, Sears's satin dress exemplifies Sargent's extraordinary skill at rendering white, subtly nuanced with painterly flourishes of lavender, blue, and pink.

This European \\xe9migr\\xe9 developed a quality of playfulness, grace, and charm-hallmarks of his style-by distilling references to both folk art and the newer trends in abstraction in American art at the time. Nadelman's sculptures derive from observed nature: specifically performers, entertainers, members of elite and vaudeville society, pianists, conductors, hosts and hostesses, and, as illustrated here, dancing couples. To produce this work, Nadelman used cherry wood. He brushed the surface with gesso and then painted each figure, wiping and rubbing the wood in order to create an aged, roughened surface that resembles the American folk art sculptures he admired and collected. Here, an elegantly dressed gentleman in black tie guides his graceful partner through the steps of the tango, a Latin American dance craze that raged in Europe and the United States during and after World War I. Although the tango is well known for its seductive qualities, this one is danced by a buttoned-up pair who perform its steps far from the ports of Buenos Aires. Nadelman simplifies forms, refining the curves and counter-curves, the masses and counter-masses. This sculpture becomes a playful image of the couple suspended in motion, gliding toward each other. Indeed, Nadelman's skill resides in isolating the sexual energy of the dance and filling the empty spaces between the man and the woman, capturing the charged moment just before their hands clasp.",

Seated in a Windsor-back armchair, the artist turns slightly and directs his gaze toward the viewer. He tilts his palette toward the viewer, and with his right hand dips his brush into the paint appearing on the palette. Without actually gripping the brush, daughter Angelica Kauffmann Peale (1775-1853) playfully appears to guide it with one hand, as her other hand points toward heaven, as if she is playing the allegorical muse of painting. To the left of the artist, Rachel Brewer Peale (1744-1790), the artist's wife, peers out of the painted canvas with an expression as life-like as those of the artist and daughter. In other words, Peale seems to beg the viewer to consider issues of illusion and reality, and the artist's magical ability to transform mere pigment (as suggested by the blobs of paint revealed to the viewer on the palette, carefully juxtaposed with the painted canvas) into life (as revealed by the vibrantly alive portrait of his wife on the easel).

This full-plate image is the only known existing full-length portrait of Houston, who stood 6 feet 2 inches tall. As the leader of the Texas Revolution and two-term president of the short-lived Republic of Texas, Houston was a knowledgeable frontiersman and liked to dress the part. However, this portrait shows him in more-conservative attire, probably to garner mass appeal for a presidential run. uThe Meade Brothers established one of the most successful photography studios in America, capturing famous subjects including Kit Carson and Commodore Matthew Perry. This portrait was probably taken in the brothers' New York studio the year after its opening, in 1850. Growing competition between portrait studios at the time led them to offer diverse options.

Latrobe's relatively archaeologically correct interpretation of the Greek form draws on the designs of Thomas Hope published shortly before and represents perhaps the earliest documented example of the style in America. The overall form, with severe rectangular lines and wide tablet, is a distinctive Philadelphia type. However, the painted decoration seems to have no parallel in other Philadelphia furniture, although very closely related painted decoration is documented to Baltimore. Likewise, the design of the en suite card table and pier table does not resemble that of other Philadelphia examples but relates to pieces made in Baltimore. What remains unclear is whether these chairs were made and painted in Philadelphia, made in Philadelphia and decorated in Baltimore, or made completely in Baltimore.",

Displayed in the Drawing Room at Bayou Bend, this splendid bureau table is recognized as one of the most brilliant renditions of the Newport block-front-a design consisting of a recessed center panel flanked by two raised panels topped by gracefully carved shells. It is generally acknowledged as the most original design achievement to emanate from colonial America.

The museum's table is confidently attributed to John Townsend who, during the course of his lengthy career, signed or labeled more than thirty pieces of furniture, a number far greater than that of any other colonial cabinetmaker. This unparalleled body of documented work makes it possible to identify his cabinetry with a high degree of certainty.

Because the American colonies lacked patron-aristocrats, the earliest manifestations of style occurred not in painting or sculpture but in the decorative arts. The silversmith, more than any other artisan, was keenly aware of the latest stylistic developments through the English-produced vessels he imported to sell alongside those of his own manufacture. John Coney was the first in this country to have fabricated several forms, including the inkstand, fork, sugar box, chafing dish, monteith, and chocolate pot. He was equally adept as an engraver, executing the copper plates for Massachusetts and New Hampshire paper currency. Coney's known work in the Mannerist and Baroque aesthetics establishes him as the most accomplished and versatile of all colonial silversmiths. This tankard is a consummate American expression of early Baroque silver. The vessel was made for John Foster, a prosperous Boston merchant and prominent official with sophisticated taste and lofty aspirations. In 1692 he erected an extraordinary house that introduced New Englanders to the Italian Renaissance style. Foster's tankard, like his mansion, is one of the most eloquent statements of style in early New England.",

The juxtaposition of textured and flat surfaces, and matte and glossy passages, imparts a great liveliness to the surface, creating a perfect counterbalance to the dark tones of the painting. The Profanation of the Host This work is the only painting and final piece in a series of more than 40 drawings Gorky produced from 1930 to 1934. The first sketches of the series were based on Paolo Uccello's 15th-century panel Nighttime, Enigma and Nostalgia , echoing its fractured space and exaggerated perspective. As the series progressed, Gorky turned his attention to more concrete details, and in particular he chose to isolate and elaborate upon the biomorphic forms that dominated the left half of his drawings. This shift introduced a new and concentrated note of psychological intensity into Gorky's work. Nighttime, Enigma and Nostalgia u is a summation painting, the definitive statement of all of Gorky's influences and concerns in the early 1930s. Cubism and Surrealism, as well as the artist's wide knowledge of the history of art, are brilliantly assimilated into the work. His masterly handling of the different degrees of black, along with the poetic sobriety of the balanced forms, reflects Gorky's interest in Spanish painting. The evidence of his hard work-scraping down and repainting-abounds in this example, testifying to the importance that Gorky assigned to it.

Chase studied in Indianapolis and New York before attending Munich Academy, where in the 1870s he absorbed the style of the Old Masters. While in Munich, Chase also mastered a bravura, painterly brush technique that would distinguish his work throughout his life. Here, his bold brushwork is particularly apparent in the treatment of the glittering surfaces of the coral and bells, white lace gown, and Japanese embroidery on the mother's robe. This grand, full-length painting was exhibited at numerous venues, including the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It received many positive reviews, including one by Chase's student Kenyon Cox, who stated, \"the main beauty of the canvas is indescribable . . . the beauty of two tones of black, one upon the other . . . the tingling pleasure that one receives from the one note of vivid scarlet that cuts through this quiet harmony like a knife?\"",

As a youth, he studied with Thomas Cole, one of the Hudson River School founders, and Cole's renderings of the Sicilian volcano Mount Etna may have provided inspiration for Cotopaxi i.

She included it in the eighth Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1886, and in her first major U.S. solo exhibition in 1895. The painting shows a nursemaid knitting while seated on a bench in a flower-bordered garden. One of her charges sleeps in a nearby carriage, and the other plays at her feet. As with much of Cassatt's work that was based on closely studying family, friends, and servants, this scene offers an intimate glimpse into the private lives of the subjects and portrays the charming characteristics of children and babies without the sentimentality that distinguished so many paintings of the time. Unusual for Cassatt, however, is the work's looser application of paint, its off-center composition, and its emphasis on the landscape. The bright sunlight knits the composition together; brilliant colors sweep through the canvas; and expertly articulated figures show the artist's disciplined draftsmanship and her ability to make them lifelike through careful dabs of paint. For example, the slightly downturned mouth of the baby in its carriage, along with the hand nestled against its face for comfort, indicate deep, peaceful sleep.",

After initially absorbing the lessons of Modernism and embracing an abstract, vivid style, Benton turned in the 1920s to developing what he considered an \"authentic American art,\" an art that was socially responsible and never aesthetically hermetic. A solid technician in the studio, Benton pioneered a painterly technique of applying pigment with egg yolk and water, and then overlaying the surface with transparent glazes. The rich tones and sensuous surfaces of his paintings are the result of this technique and of his heavily managed brushwork, in which he picked details out of the wet surface of the paint.

Like many artists of his generation, in the 1930s he participated in the U.S. government's WPA Federal Art Project. Influenced by the \\xe8migr\\xe8 Surrealists who sought refuge in New York during World War II, Gottlieb explored a new abstract language, one loaded with mystical and mythological content. , In the mid-1950s Gottlieb began to oppose closed and open forms, a motif that evolved into the famous Bursts that many view as the culmination of his career. Gottlieb reduced his composition to two essential components: a radiant red circle floating above a lively maze of large black brushstrokes. The rival forms one serene and heavenly, the other turbulent and expressive have been seen to represent essential pairs such as order and chaos, female and male, or heaven and earth. Charged with emotional resonance, Penumbra shows Gottlieb at the height of his powers.",

A View of Asheville, North Carolina The first artist of African American descent to gain national and international acclaim, Duncanson emerged in the 1850s as the principal painter in and around the Cincinnati area. During the summers of 1850 through 1852, he traveled and sketched in the Ohio River Valley, visiting the western North Carolina city of Asheville, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains. u depicts two figures looking out over the valley, one touching the shoulder of the other and motioning toward the town. The focal points of the work, however, are the dramatic mountain range in the background and the sky above, which displays the elegant transition from the golden glow of the sun at right to blue at center. Gnarled and blasted trees bracket the image, an allusion to the passage of time and America's primordial past. Juxtaposed against the cleared valley and developing city below, they warn about man's encroachment on and destruction of nature,",

The work brilliantly expresses two major themes that dominated early American genre paintings: the growing concern about divisions between the North and South in the pre-Civil War years, and the social interactions among ordinary Americans in public places. This lively tavern scene by American painter Charles Deas is rich with hidden meanings that audiences would have understood in the 1830s. The figure of the con man thumbs his nose (as much a sign of indignation in the 19th century as it is today) and invites the viewer to question the scene as a scam. Although commonly a sign of fidelity, the slouched dog may refer to the popular phrase drunk as a dog, raising concerns about the excessive consumption of alcohol that would culminate in the temperance movement. The issue of slavery is suggested by the presence of the African American straddling the line, expressing the mounting apprehensions about national unity and balance as states entered the Union as either slave-holding or free. Such is the stuff of 19th-century American genre paintings that their potential meanings may be endlessly discussed and debated, the very feature of U.S. democracy that this art form aimed to celebrate.",

In 1961 he produced four additional Sentinel sculptures, all of which are characterized by flat planes of highly burnished stainless steel.

Here, two black trees frame a luminous chestnut tree covered with flowers that appear as though they are dabs of paint.

Created in a Romantic vein, this 1905 photograph of trees is more about light and the mood of the setting than faithful representation, uSteichen was an important figure in American art history not only as a photographer but also as an advocate for American art, discovering and fostering artistic talent.

Upon his return to the United States, Strand compiled a portfolio that garnered the 26-year-old a one-man show with photographer and gallery owner Alfred Stieglitz. Strand's work was of particular and timely interest to Stieglitz, who had been seeking photographic divergence from the then-dominant style, Pictorialism. Stieglitz sought images that could keep pace with the 20th-century experience, and Strand's work fit the bill, In the summer of 1916, Strand produced a series of compositional studies that pushed the medium of photography into artistic terrain that had been considered too complex to master with a camera. Influenced by the work of Paul C\\xe9zanne, Pablo Picasso, and other Cubist artists, Strand worked closely with still lifes, removing subjects from their normal surroundings and shaping novel approaches to perspective and composition.

Through confronting issues of space, dimensionality, and perspective, Strand's photographic still lifes, along with modern views of the city by Stieglitz and other photographers, created a brand-new Modernist aesthetic within photography. Strand employed what he called straight photographic methods to clearly see the limitations and at the same time the potential qualities of his medium.

The photographs not only documented what the doctor did, but also explored the emotional dimension of the physician's profession, An advocate for moral responsibility in journalism, Smith sought to awaken the conscience of viewers through his photographs. By carefully selecting his subjects and then spending substantial periods of time with them to get a more intimate perspective on their lives, he created in-depth essays that evoke viewer sympathy. This process revolutionized the new field of photojournalism by expanding the scope of what a photo essay could be. Although Smith created several other seminal essays for Life , he felt that the photo essay should be largely managed by the photographer, a view that created friction with editors who were more text-oriented.

Born in Pennsylvania to a prosperous farming family, Heade spent his early years hunting, fishing, and learning to love nature-a passion that led him to paint in landscape and still life more than other genres. Even in an age of peripatetic artists, he was more widely traveled than most, living variously in Europe and America, and traveling to South America on three occasions. uHeade moved in 1883 to Florida, where flourishing tropical flowers like magnolias both encouraged his interest in natural history and appealed to him artistically. He repeatedly painted magnolias, creating compositions that are infinitely varied and show evidence of various alterations that he made while painting. The subtle shifts within his work as a whole account in part for Heade's appeal to modern sensibilities. Although Heade's work received only limited artistic acclaim during his lifetime, his paintings were \"rediscovered\" in the 1940s, and he has since evolved into an undisputed modern American master.",

Assembled from thrown and hand-built forms, the chalices are totemic, sculptural compositions that demonstrate true harmony between form and glaze. Wood's interest in ceramics was initially stirred by the purchase of six Dutch lusterware plates in 1933. Eager for a matching teapot, she enrolled in a ceramics class. After establishing her own studio, Wood created forms that were the result of free exploration, with experimental glazes. For the next 40 years, she made thrown and hand-built vessels and figures in a range of colors and textures. At once vivid and subtle, her glazes had depth and tonal richness and seemed to be molded with light. This spectrum was achieved through her all-over, in-glaze luster that, when fired, caused metallic salts to rise to the surface, a complex process almost impossible to control.
