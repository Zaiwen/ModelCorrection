A tumultuous group of figures and horses crowds around the feet of Jesus at the left, with rearing horses, the Virgin weeping, and Saint John pointing at himself; but the top left of the composition remains open. With such techniques, Hans von Aachen created an effect of dramatic spaciousness.Von Aachen probably made this large and impressive drawing as a preliminary study for a painting. He first sketched the composition extensively in black chalk, which is particularly visible in the torso and hand of the thief in the upper left corner and in the city of Jerusalem in the lower right. Next he laid in the figure groups in graywash, making extensive use of the white paper for highlights; finally, he worked over the entire composition, defining elements with relatively sparing touches of pen and brown ink.",

The park at Saint-Cloud originally surrounded a royal ch\u00e2teau, and contained sculptures, fountains, reflecting pools, and a manicured lawn. This photograph's dynamic composition reflects some of the garden's formal elements. The picture also displays the increased expressiveness that characterized Atget's last works.Contrary to accepted photographic practice, Atget aimed his camera toward the sun, blocking it with the silhouette of a large tree in the foreground. The viewer's perspective is similar to what would be seen sitting underneath the tree's canopy. The tree frames the receding landscape's horizontal bands of light and dark: a wall of foliage in the far distance, a reflecting pool in the center, and a stretch of grass in the foreground.Atget's asymmetrical composition is radical for its elegant simplicity--an effect somewhat heightened by the print's high-contrast tones. Berenice Abbott, a young American photographer who befriended Atget and purchased many of his prints and negatives after his death, made this print some fifteen years later.",

It is, however, quite typical for the Affecter, who focused primarily on the decorative aspects of figures. His unusual approach to potting is also evident on this vase, where he threw an old-fashioned neck-amphora form but modified it by adding a raised ring to separate the neck from the body.

The most basic education in one of these schools would have involved reading and writing and perhaps arithmetic. At about the same time, scenes of youths at school learning their lessons began to appear on Athenian vases, part of a growing interest on the part of vase-painters in depicting scenes of daily life.This smallred-figurecup fragment shows a boy holding a scroll while another person, perhaps his teacher, stands in front of him. Scholars have disagreed over what the scroll says. Some read it as the beginning of a list of mythological figures. Others see it as a fragment from an epic poem by Hesiod, \"The Catalog of Women.\" The latter interpretation may be more accurate since all other scrolls in school scenes contain epic poetry.

This drawing is the second in a series of five preparatory studies Heinrich Aldegrever made for a set of engravings.

While Dives lived in luxury, Lazarus lived off the crumbs from his table. When the two died, Lazarus was taken to heaven, while Dives went to hell. Dives was punished for eternity because of his mistreatment of Lazarus on earth.Although the story takes place in the early Christian era, Aldegrever placed the figures in a fashionable interior of the 1500s. Artists often chose to use contemporary settings to make it easier for their viewers to identify with the characters. Dives's feast takes place in a sumptuous interior decorated with bottle glass windows. On the floor, glass vessels fill a wine cooler. Elaborately attired figures seated around the banquet table fail to show the beggar any charity. A servant carrying chafing dishes high above his head emphasizes that Dives's abundant food is unobtainable for Lazarus.",

Her elegant outfit is complemented by an array of jewelry--a long strand of pearls, a necklace set with precious stones, a pendant with a smallreliefof theHoly Family, and pearl drop earrings. The sitter was clearly a woman of status and affluence, and the sculptor depicted her with a powerful and distinctive psychological presence.The fine details of the sitter's costume, jewelry, and hairstyle display a true mastery of marble carving. Maria Cerri's intricate coiffure--amassof curls ornamented with loops of satiny ribbon--falls gracefully around her face. Algardi sculpted the delicate lace mantle in low relief with subtle contours that reveal how the garment fell around the sitter's shoulders. The strand of pearls, which weaves across the sitter's chest and around her sash, is carved entirely in the round. The attention given to her lace and jewelry makes this as much a portrait of her accessories as of the subject herself.Married in 1637, Maria Cerri and Bartolomeo Capranica were from prominent Roman families. Acoat of armsidentifying both families appears at the base of the sculpture. Maria Cerri died at the age of twenty-five in 1643.",

Her scallop-shell chariot drawn by two dolphins is a common attribute, recalling her birth from the sea. In the background, Neptune, ruler of the sea, brandishes his trident and rides in a shell chariot drawn by two hippocamps (sea horses).In this drawing, Alessandro Algardi combined idealization of the human body derived from classical sculpture with convincing, realistic representation based on close observation of the human form. His energetic use of chalk imbued the scene with movement and caught the effect of light, particularly in his modeling of Venus's soft skin and the tritons' muscular flesh.Algardi most often made drawings in association with sculptural projects. As the master of the illusionistic pictorial relief during the Baroque era in Rome, he may have designed this arrangement of figures for a low-relief sculpture, possibly for execution in embossed metalwork. Either Algardi, an assistant, or a later artist pricked only the outlines of the main group for transfer to another surface. Only the main group may have been used, or the project may have been abandoned or altered on the right side.",

By inserting the Holy Family, which fits so naturally into the composition, the elder Algardi may have meant to improve his junior colleague's composition. The figural group balances the central tree and gives the landscape a recognizable subject matter. To achieve greaterluster, Algardi also may have added the brownwashthroughout.The artists' styles are distinctive. Algardi drew his playful family grouping with a more delicate, graceful, even fragile line than Grimaldi's bold squiggles and hatching, which are especially evident in the dynamic, dominant tree.These two artists often worked together on architectural commissions, yet only one other similar sheet exists, an architectural drawing in which Algardi corrected and added to Grimaldi's work.

For I can show not only what I think but what I know.Alma Tadema's paintings also enjoyed popularity later, when his large panoramic depictions of Greek and Roman life caught the attention of Hollywood.

The crowd presses forward onto the four central figures, wrapping around them and creating a claustrophobic effect. The bold vertical lines of the cross and the soldier's pike lead the viewer's eyes diagonally down to the main image of the kneeling Christ. Altdorfer displayed exceptionally varied line work, particularly in the figure of Christ.

Manuel Alvarez Bravo selected works from his own library for this composition, which suggests a towering form of modern architecture. At the bottom of the stack is Maurice Raynal's 1922 monograph on Picasso, a foundational text that greatly influenced Alvarez Bravo. Picasso's work encouraged the artist to experiment with abstract and cubist compositions. The viewer can only speculate about the contents of the books stacked on top of the monograph, but it is likely that these volumes were equally important to Alvarez Bravo's development as a photographer.This formal, abstract image indicates that, by 1930, Alvarez Bravo had absorbed many contemporary modernist ideas, even though he lived in Mexico City, far from the main centers of avant-garde artistic production. Because of his location, Alvarez Bravo depended largely on printed words and images as sources of inspiration.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser",

Tamayo, a mural painter, saw Alvarez Bravo's work in a 1928 exhibition. It was the first time Alvarez Bravo exhibited his photographs. Interested in reactions, he stood nearby hoping to eavesdrop on a conversation. Two people stood talking, then approached Alvarez Bravo. One of the individuals was Tamayo. He was the first artist to respond to Alvarez Bravo's work, and the two shared a close friendship from that moment forward.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser",

By relegating the figures to the extreme lower foreground and filling the remainder of the composition with tree trunks and branches, Alvarez Bravo illustrated their lowly status. To symbolize the almost impossible task of improving one's circumstances, he cropped the couple's feet out of the photograph.

Instead, he arrived upon the scene of a sugar-mill labor strike, where shots were being fired. With two frames left in his camera, Alvarez Bravo moved in close and framed his subject so that the the top border of the photograph would press against the victim's body, as if it were the lid of a coffin. A trail of blood spills into the image's lower right corner.Without denying his handsome features or dignity, Alvarez Bravo portrayed the felled worker neither as a hero nor as a martyr, but simply as a sacrifice. As one historian has observed: \"The offering of human lives in ancient Mexico was natural; [the worker's] death is no more than a ritual sacrifice to the gods of society, a mere necessity for the well-being of the Mexican people\u0085\"",

He called the seriesMorning Notebook, suggesting that the female body was a construction that could be documented and then read like words on a page. During this period, many Surrealist artists, whose work influenced Alvarez Bravo, used the female form in much the same way--for clearly visible consumption.",

This assortment of X-Ray images illustrating the internal skeletal structure of the human body was mounted outside the laboratory storefront of a colonial building in downtown Mexico City.

The miracle occurred when the venerated statue was found shattered and in its place rose a crucified figure.

On therecto, with strong, sure strokes, he worked out the musculature of the kneeling apostle who appears in the painting's left foreground. On theverso, the standing nude figure with drapery provides the pose for Saint Thomas. Of the two heads later crossed out by the artist, the one at the upper right resembles the apostle on the recto. Del Sarto used these poses again in other paintings.Del Sarto's working process of making a series of preparatory drawings for each of his paintings became a model for other artists of the 1500s. He began by quickly jotting down a first idea, then, as in the kneeling figure on the recto, he made studies of individual figures, checking them against a live model. He also used sculpture as a source. Del Sarto then developed the initial composition into a sequence of studies drawn in rapid, soft strokes of black or red chalk, which led to the final version for the painting. The finalcartoonwas transferred to the wall or panel.",

Solely to develop the figure's overall pose, he made the nude study for Moses on theverso, which is much more simply drawn. While del Sarto continued the Florentine HighRenaissancetradition of the large, classic form and measured pose, he also began to deviate slightly from their ideals. The nude figure on the verso may no longer quite represent ideal proportions; he is more stocky, perhaps more like a peasant, when compared to the consistently noble nature of figures by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael.",

Each side contains two separate compartments with figures in varied poses.With quick, sure strokes of his red chalk, del Sarto experimented with a variety of complex arrangements for each figure's body, sometimes including drapery and always crossing limbs and turning heads. He overlaid numerous ideas for each figure, quickly trying one thought, then modifying it for the next. Beyond giving the figures balance, he aimed to make them look natural and relaxed. With the railing both standing in front of and bisecting the figures, the artist also had to work out how to maintain unity between the upper and lower halves of each figure. The many artistic solutions evident in this study give a glimpse of his fertile and creative mind.Scholars are uncertain about the purpose of these studies, but they may have been initial concepts for the Evangelists in the border of theParamento Passerini, an embroidered altar frontal now in the Museum Diocesano, Cortona.",

It would probably have been set in front of a mirror, so that the elaborately painted scene on the back could also be admired. At the time the vase was produced, the vivid turquoise ground color, developed with aquamarinepigmentimported from Venice, was a recent invention and much admired.The elaborategildingthat frames the bird scenes and marks the edges of the vase is also notable for the skill it required. Gilding had to be applied at least twice over this ground color, as the turquoise-blue color tended to absorb the gold during firing because of its high copper content.",

In the 1400s, the image of the nude male and the use of bronze were revived as Italian artists looked back to the culture of ancient Greece and Rome for inspiration. Though its subject is ancient, this work was conceived in a thoroughly innovative style of expressionistic and dramatic movement. In typicalManneriststyle, the figure twists elegantly, revealing a play of shimmering effects on the surface as the light reflects off pronounced muscles. The figure's animated face, as if in mid-speech, was designed to engage the viewer, much as his pose encouraged the viewer to walk around the sculpture.",

Stooped under the black drape that attached to his bulky camera, Atget evidently captured the curiosity and attention of most of the guards, who gaze at the photographer.Although Atget's primary interest was in documenting the architecture and people of Paris, he often inadvertently captured supplementary information. An advertisement for absinthe, a liquor flavored with wormwood and fennel, appears adjacent to the guards on the right side of the photograph. Soon after this picture was taken, the beverage was outlawed in France because a chemical in one of its ingredients caused convulsions, hallucinations, mental deterioration, and psychoses.

Travelers crossed this monumental bridge ornamented with majestic fountains along the forty-mile road from Paris south-southeast to Fontainebleau, one of the largest palaces built by the kings of France.King Louis XV commissioned the fountains and their sculptural finials as part of his 1728 campaign to improve and embellish French thoroughfares. The water from the fountains provided refreshment for dusty travelers and their horses, but the grandeur of the wide road and its decorative monuments was also especially fitting for the sumptuous destination.",

Although the path is not occupied on this wintry day, the presence of a few gentlemen--one overlooking the River Seine, another seated on a park bench--suggest that Parisians frequently traveled along it.During the 1600s the rich decoration of the Palais de Luxembourg had a powerful influence on French taste, especially on interior decoration. One of many former royal residences of historical significance in Paris, it saw other uses after the monarchy fell. It served as a prison during the French Revolution, and the senate assembled there during the reign of Napoleon.",

A lamppost appears to be up for sale alongside a mantel clock; a wagon wheel is displayed just under a cherub to the right of the vases.

This room was undoubtedly the most luxurious of all, located in an ornate building then serving as the Austrian Embassy.In this relatively close-up view, Atget focused on a fireplace with an elaborate clock and candelabras on its mantel, and two floral-patterned chairs on either side. The fireplace is filled with a large mirror that reflects a slipcovered couch, and on it, Atget's hat and overcoat. The photographer's tripod-mounted camera is nearby with a black focusing cloth draped over it. These items suggest the image as a kind of self-portrait, although Atget probably did not intend it as such.Atget was so personally interested in the history of Paris that he spent years documenting the city.

As a result, the picture gives the dramatic impression that it was made during that indistinct period of early morning when the sun is rising and night is fading away. Other prints of this image are lighter and, consequently, less striking. To accommodate the tall structure within the parameters of his lens, Atget was forced to position his camera at a considerable distance from the building, filling the foreground with an expansive fork in the road.",

Securing the specimens to the paper with a sheet of glass, the glass and paper were then placed in the sun; after sufficient exposure to light, the paper was washed in water, which caused the image to appear in its final form.

A print such as this one promoted the collection of the drawing's owner, Mr. Willet. It also educated the public on the rare visit of an exotic individual more than one hundred and fifty years earlier.

He played with the more unusual circular format, echoing its roundness with the girl's head, cap, and stiff lace collar, and added expression to her eyes by scratching the paper to create her pupils' whitehighlights. Influenced by the relaxed approach to portraiture that took hold in Holland around the beginning of the 1600s, Bailly gave the girl expressive eyes, the hint of a smile, and stray locks of hair coming loose from her formal lace headdress.With drawings like this one, Bailly continued the tradition of miniature portrait drawings and engravings that Hendrick Goltzius and Jacques de Gheyn II had established at the end of the 1500s.

After Valori's death, the collection remained intact, becoming part of the Uffizi Gallery's collection in 1866. Baldinucci also made duplicates for his own collection. These duplicate drawings, unbound from the book in which he collected them, were dispersed at London sales in the 1760s. Scholars are uncertain about the identity of this sitter. Theversodisplays an accidental offset from another portrait drawing, most likely by Baldinucci, which suggests that this drawing probably came from his book of duplicates.

Some scholars have suggested that the image's popularity was politically motivated: the tyrants of Athens in this period, Peisistratos and his sons, had adopted Herakles as their symbol. An account of Peisistratos's return from exile, in fact, describes how he had a woman dressed as Athena ride in the chariot with him. This vase was broken and extensively repaired inantiquity. One handle was reattached with staples, and the mouth of the amphora was replaced with one taken from another similar amphora.

Here Barocci studied tonal values for the painting, building a largely monochrome composition from rich, dark browns with brilliant bluish-white highlights in the figures' robes, especially that of the figure on the left who supports Christ's legs. He left the kneeling figure of Saint Mary Magdalene unfinished in the right foreground, though she appears in a similar pose and position in the later, more colorful oil sketch and the finished painting.Barocci commonly used an elaborate preparatory method for planning his pictures.

Here he combined blue paper, widely used by Venetian draftsmen, with natural black chalk and colored fabricated chalks, including blue, mauve, red, yellow, and peach. Thoughtful consideration of color was integral to his preparation for painting. Bassano used color, not line, to articulate space. The flesh and peach tones in the reclining males at left project outward, Christ's mauve robe draws the eye into space, and the central figure's red costume provides a focal point in themiddle ground.Bassano illustrated an important episode from theNew Testament, in whichJesusshowed his authority in the Temple of Jerusalem, saying, \"Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers\" (Mark 11:17). After Jesus threw the money changers out of the temple, the chief priests and scribes \"kept looking for a way to kill him; for they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching.\"",

Without the use of a camera or lens, Hippolyte Bayard carefully arranged a delicate selection of laces and flora on a sheet of paper that was made sensitive to light with a combination of iron salts that produced a blue-tonedcyanotypewhen developed. The sheet of sensitized paper with the objects placed upon it is exposed to sunlight in order to make a camera-lessphotogenic drawing.The opacity of the object blocks the light in relation to its density, thus creating a silhouette of the object on the paper. Because the process was relatively uncomplicated, cyanotypes provided a quick method of recording easily recognizable shapes and patterns.

These graphical forms support the photograph's gridlikecomposition, which seems curiously at odds with its gentle framing. The oval mask may have been an attempt to soften the subject's starkness, following a fine-art approach adopted by photographers in the 1800s.Bayard made many views of Paris in the early years following photography's invention, favoring the British-inventedcalotypeprocess over France'sdaguerreotypeprocess.

Behind them stands a large, elaborate throne with sphinxes at each armrest and carved, winged dragons on top. Peacock feathers fan from the crest, and jewels line its upper edge.The double arcade that arches over the throne is a whimsical structure created by the Beauvais artists rather than an authentic Chinese form. This fantastic architecture with its spindly Gothic ornament may have inspired designers of the late 1700s and early 1800s who copied the mixture of Gothic and Far Eastern motifs. This series may be one of the earliest examples of the emergingchinoiseriestyle, in which Westerners employed exotic Chinese forms combined with European motifs.",

        "description": "In the mid-1700s, the French kingLouis XVcommissioned the renowned Beauvais manufactory to create a series of tapestries illustrating scenes from the story of Psyche. The manufactory turned to artist Fran\u00e7ois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.",

You have to eliminate, and then you can compare anything that's taken from a similar angle.--Hilla BecherDeveloping a systemized approach that they employed consistently throughout their their joint career, Bernd and Hilla Becher documented the Western World's bulwarks of heavy industry, such as this blast furnace. Their no-frills approach is evident in the way that they carefully centered this building's complex structure to fill the picture frame. They also took advantage of natural, even light to reveal reflective surfaces and multiple tiers of scaffolding in exquisite detail. Hilla Becher has likened the blast furnace building type to an \"octopus,\" with its extended pipes resembling tentacles. When she and Bernd initially considered photographing blast furnaces, it seemed a daunting task. Ultimately, it became her favorite type of structure to approach for the challenge it presented of making sense of its complex form through multiple views.Built solely for the function of smelting iron ore, the blast furnace is one of a number of archaic, anonymously constructed industrial building types that the Bechers focused on throughout their career. Other building types include: lime kilns, cooling towers, winding towers, water towers, gas tanks, and silos. In the forward to their bookAnonyme Skulpturen(Anonymous Sculptures), the Bechers wrote of their subjects: \"They are generally buildings where anonymity is accepted to be the style. Their peculiarities originate not in spite of, but because of, the lack of design.\"",

The care with which he described the intricate pits, crevices, and ridges, particularly on the underside of the middle skull, suggests that he drew them from life. His keen interest in anatomy was a typical manifestation of the emphasis that theRenaissanceplaced on the study of the human form.Beham also varied the level of finish on each skull. He chose to simply outline the right skull with black ink and to use a more complex technique of hatching and cross-hatching to create the shadows and hollows of the base on the center one. The left skull, with its iridescent brow glowing with white bodycolorheightening, a bold outline, and the use of gray wash to cast shadows and create depth, emphasizes Beham's graphic expressiveness. The drawing appears to have been a preparatory sketch for a print.On the other side of the sheet, Beham freely sketched an architectural study showing the top portion of a facade. Scholars are uncertain whether this was simply a fantasy building or a structure to be used for a specific festival.",

Artists typically portrayed such figures in motion, striding forward with a flag fully unfurled, but Beham chose a static, frontal composition instead. The standard bearer strikes a classical contrapposto pose to balance the visual and actual weight of the massive flag, drawn with delicate penmanship.The standard bearer wears an elegant doublet with wide, flowing sleeves that have been quite literally \"torn to ribbons.\" The fashion for slashing garments became extremely popular in Europe in the early 1500s, particularly in Germany, where it reached the most extravagant levels. Tailors cut slits in the clothing and pulled the lining through to show off its different color. In the same lavish style, the man wears tights held up with ribbons tied below the knee and a broad hat covered with multiple long plumes. Throughout the drawing, the nineteen-year-old artist used distinctive strokes such as the short, hooked lines on the man's thighs and gnarled collarbone. In the dark folds of the flag, Beham explored shadowy areas through varied patches of dark hatching.",

The position of legs and arms, the tilt of the head that echoes the line of his extended foot, the doubled lines that emphasize the movement of the leg, and the curved surface of the jar and the cheeses on the ground display Beham's skill in depicting figures and three-dimensional objects. Beham produced numerous drawings and prints that included peasants going about their daily activities. This picture of a young peasant boy and its pendant showing a peasant woman carrying a jug were probably once on the same sheet of paper.

The drawing's simplified linear style appropriately renders their air of homespun piety. Sebald Beham relied upon simple, bold outlines and hatching to describe the scene, since few details would be visible once the scene was set high in a church window.During the 1520s, Beham and his workshop produced many designs for stained-glass windows. This highly finished sketch was part of a series of more than twenty-five works made for a group of windows showing scenes from the lives of the Virgin and Christ. The drawing functioned as a cartoon for a specialist stained-glass maker, who then cut and painted the glass in shapes and colors according to the design. The color notations and red chalk lines inscribed throughout the drawing indicate the placement of glass sections and leading. The lead was then soldered and cemented around the glass pieces before the panels were secured to the window's iron cross-bars.",

Personal prayer books played an important role in the daily spiritual life of clergy and laity alike. In the later Middle Ages, as the devout sought a more personal and intimate approach to spirituality, their books became increasingly individualized in their content and decoration. The text of this book is a collection of sixty-two devotional prayers, the majority of which focuses on Jesus' life and Passion. It was copied from a book printed in Augsburg in 1521, a German translation of the original Latin text. The Cardinal, however, chose to commission a hand-written and illuminated copy, probably preferring the luxuriousness of parchment and color-saturated images to the paper and monochromatic woodcuts of printed books. He selected an artist who could bring out the rich narrative and subtle psychological elements in the story of Christ's Passion. The sequence of forty-one brilliantly colored, full-page miniatures that Bening produced for the manuscript was designed to evoke an intense empathic response as the viewer contemplated Jesus' suffering.",

On the third day they discovered him in the Temple conversing among the doctors, who were all impressed with his wisdom. When asked by his mother why he had caused his family worry, Jesus responded, \"Did you not know that I must be about my father's business?\"",

Following Saint Matthew'sGospel, Caiaphas tears at his robe as he accuses Jesus of blasphemy for identifying himself as theMessiah. In contrast, Jesus, his physical beauty underscoring his divinity, calmly accepts his destiny. The artist heightened the drama of the confrontation by setting the scene in a darkened, monumental interior,illuminatedonly by eerie torchlight. By depicting a vulnerable and very human Jesus, Bening encouraged the reader to empathize with Jesus' suffering, a response that the Church and much religious art of the later Middle Ages promoted.Bening framed the scene with simulated wood arches, suggesting that the viewer is peering through a window into a real, three-dimensional space.

According to the Gospels, Pilate found Christ innocent but was reluctant to release him because the Jews wanted him executed. Bowing to the demands of the crowd, he decided to follow custom and release a prisoner onPassover. Upon asking the Jews whether they wanted to free Christ or the robber Barabbas, the people called for Barabbas. Pilate gave in to the wishes of the people but publicly washed his hands as a sign of his disagreement with the decision.",

The document lists in detail not only the names of most of the artisans who worked on the cabinet, but also the cost of each part--an unusual and fascinating detail. From this document, researchers learned that the most expensive part of this piece was the elaborately chased and gilded mounts, which show symbols of the king.At some point in the early 1800s, someone replaced the lacquer panels withpietre dure(hardstone) plaques. The companion piece, now in the Royal Palace in Madrid, has been changed too; marquetry panels showing harbor scenes replaced the original lacquer.The mounts were cast by \u00c9tienne-Jean Forestier and Denis Bardin.

Two huntsmen converse with a hostess-- perhaps regaling her with tales from the day's chase. On the balcony above, a washerwoman sets out laundry. At left, partly shrouded in shade, a woman serves two seated men. Above this trio, two pairs of tiny figures explore the upper reaches of the towering ruin behind the inn.Nicolaes Berchem is best known for his imaginary Italianate landscapes. In these panoramic paintings, figures generally play a secondary role. By contrast, inThe Return From the Hunt, Berchem focused on the interaction between figures and architectural setting rather than the landscape. The unusual vertical format showcases the artist's command of light. Light falling on the mounted horseman also illuminates the woman on the balcony as well as the figures on the left.Hunters at rest was a popular subject among northern genre painters in the 1600s.

Much like Bruegel's figures, Berents' skaters have a somewhat comical air about them due to the extra long blades on their ice skates.

        "description": "When he was less than twenty years old, Gian Lorenzo Bernini carved this marble boy with a dragon for the palace of Maffeo Barberini, later Pope Urban VIII. Even at this young age, Bernini was such a skilled marble sculptor that he could differentiate the textures of pudgy flesh, soft hair, waves of water, and dragon scales. A hole in the dragon's mouth shows that the sculpture was used as a fountain.The infant Hercules, who demonstrated his divine strength even as an infant by slaying poisonous serpents, appears here as a mischievous boy who smiles, sits on the dragon, and breaks its jaw with his bare hands. Common in Hellenistic statuary, the theme of Hercules and the serpent was revived in sculpture of the early 1600s. Bernini probably based the composition of his work on an antique work, but contemporary concerns also played a role. He may have represented the serpent as a dragon because his patron, Barberini, wished to convey a satirical message about another important Roman patron, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, whose family coat of arms included a dragon.",

His unruly hair and beard and the billowing drapery that winds around his muscled figure evoke the sense of a whipping wind over the ocean. The flattened planes with which the sculptor modeled the muscles on the chest, arms, and legs heighten the feel of strength in the figure's movements. His intense focus on an unseen object before him adds a menacing tone. This drama of physicality and motion is characteristic of the Baroque style.The tabletop bronze is a reduced variant of a marble fountain sculpture made by Gian Lorenzo Bernini around 1620 for the garden of the great collector and patron, Cardinal Montalto, in Rome. All of the four known versions in bronze include a long-bodied dolphin between Neptune's legs, replacing the figure of a triton who served as a supportive strut on the marble statue. Reductions in bronze are unusual in Roman sculpture of the time; the multiple reproductions of Neptune are probably due to the celebrity of its maker, who dominated Roman sculptural production in the seventeenth century.",

Quick, curving lines and rough shading fill the drawing with vibrant movement: the dolphin in particular seethes with energy. Gian Lorenzo Bernini swiftly outlined the shapes of the rock formations as well as the marine god and dolphin. Using some blunt tool, perhaps even a thumb or finger, he softly smudged the lines to create the shadows that form the contorted pose of the god's muscular torso. Between 1652 and 1653, Bernini sent studies for fountains to Duke Francesco I d'Este for his palace. Other craftsmen transferred this particular design into a terracotta model, and then local, less accomplished workers produced a more static stucco fountain for the central niche of the palace.",

A steep hillside ridge in the distance echoes this line of light tracing the roadway, dividing the image into thirds. At the painting's center, horizontal shapes meet vertical ones, created by the upward thrust of village dwellings. Interestingly, the artist's careful observation of light both enhances and obscures this obsession with geometry. Late afternoon sun throws most of the scene's natural and manmade subjects into shadow, with surprising punctuations of color and light in the sky and foreground.Bertin's Neoclassical approach to landscape painting reflects that movement's emphasis on structure and form, as evident here in a calculated arrangement of forms for overall harmony. Like other landscape painters of his time, Bertin made outdoor sketches not to exhibit them, but to record the effects of light and atmosphere so he could recreate them in highly finished works made in the studio. This sketch was meant to inform those polished yet imaginary landscapes, making them more convincing to the eye.",

Silvery morning light dances across the undulating planes, rendered in soft blues, greens, and browns, and highlighted with autumnal yellows. The extraordinary freshness and precision that characterizes this painting conveys the immediacy of nature's impression on Bidauld, and explains why, upon hearing his name, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was moved to exclaim: \"Bidauld!

In the upper right, the tendrils of a squash or gourd plant reach out towards the center, with a fruit lying beneath the shade of its leaves. Abraham Bloemaert effectively contrasted such details as the broad leaves of the cabbage, with its coarse pattern of veins, with the delicate squash tendrils. Carefully applied areas of blue wash indicate shadows but also trail off into an atmospheric suggestion of continuity with the surrounding terrain.One of Bloemaert's contemporaries noted that \"he has a clever way of drawing with a pen, and by adding small amounts of watercolor, he produced unusual effects.\" The spiraling forms ofnaturalisticmotifscaptivated Bloemaert and other Dutch artists in the 1600s. He frequently enlivened theforegroundof his paintings and designs for prints with detailed illusionistically drawn plants. Being especially attracted to the pairing of cabbages and gourds, Bloemaert probably made this drawing as a study for such motifs in paintings or prints.",

From the soft, firm contours to the graceful wisps of hair that frame her head and neck so naturally, Abraham Bloemaert delicately modulated his red chalk line on creamy paper. Subtly and sensitively, he then touched in the white bodycolor that makes her luminous skin seem alive. Bloemaert probably made these studies for general practice; no paintings or prints directly relate to this sheet, though the lower profile image recalls an engraving after one of his designs.Bloemaert probably made the counterproof of the kneeling man on theversoby dampening an original drawing, then laying a clean damp sheet on top and running it through a press. Seeing the figure in reverse may have brought a fresh viewpoint to his work. The kneeling man bears a general resemblance to the shepherds in Bloemaert'sAdorationpictures. The hands sketched next to the man make gestures fitting for such a subject, but no known paintings directly resemble these studies.",

As he wandered the streets of New York City, he came upon the right type of light to test out his ideas: a dark background behind a brightly lit public walkway where he could anonymously record passersby. The sidewalk in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral proved to be the ideal place.Donald Blumberg's seriesIn Front of St. Patrick's Cathedralwas made along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan between 1965 and 1967.

Blumberg planned and shot sequences that depicted a single figure successively, changed its scale, or blurred its appearance as he moved the camera during long exposures.

Rembrandt was especially important to Bonvin and this drawing recalls Rembrandt's many dramatic, probing self-portraits.

While Pegasos strikes at the Chimaera with his hooves, Bellerophon spears the monster from underneath.The unique, symmetrical arrangement of the rearing horse and monster framing the hero is the result of the artist's attempt to find creative ways to fill the circular area of the interior of a cup. Three ornamental bands and palmettes at the handles decorate the cup's exterior.Lakonian vase-painters specialized in the decoration of cups; this example, with its high foot and slanting rim, fits the typical form.

Rendering meticulous detail, Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder conveyed the silky texture of the petals, the prickliness of the rose thorns, and the fragility of opening buds. Insects crawl, alight, or perch on the bouquet. Each is carefully described and observed, from the dragonfly's transparent wings to the butterfly's minutely painted antennae. Although a vague reference, insects, short-lived like flowers, are a reminder of the brevity of life and the transience of its beauty.A rising interest in botany and a passion for flowers led to an increase in painted floral still lifes at the end of the 1500s in both the Netherlands and Germany.

One triton blows on his shell-trumpet while the other, wedged between his partner and a fantastical dolphin, empties water out of his horn. In both sea and sky, putti pay tribute to the goddess. Amid all this attention, Venus remains impassive, decidedly detached from the churning sea.Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's immense popularity in eighteenth-century Europe was matched by his versatility; he created everything from cabinet paintings to tapestry and stage designs. But this drawing is one of only three known gouaches by Boucher. In this work, the painter loosely applied the media--his handling varying from the expressive, almost chaotic, energy of the sea to the delicate, linear touch applied to Venus and her female attendants. Given its large size and ambitious composition, the gouache was probably created as an independent work of art and not as a study for a painting. Boucher frequently depicted this goddess, and the gouache bears a striking resemblance to hisVenus on the Waves, a later oil painting also in the Getty's collection.",

Boccaccio's book was a collection of stories about exemplary heroes and heroines from biblical,classical, and medieval history. Laurent de Premierfait, who undertook this French translation(Des cas des nobles hommes et femmes),added additional tales from both ancient and more recent sources to Boccaccio's. All but one of theminiaturesin this volume were painted by the Boucicaut Master, one of the finest Parisianilluminatorsof the early fifteenth century, and his workshop of highly trained collaborators. In his framed miniatures, the Boucicaut Master used newly developed and highly saturated colors that were very expensive at the time. The high quality of theilluminationsand the scale of the decoration suggest that this book was made for someone in the court circle of King Charles VI of France.",

After the death of his brother, Ptolemy married Cleopatra, his brother's widow. To avoid sharing power with her son, he had the child, who was both his nephew and stepson, murdered.The severed head and limbs in the image, however, belong not to this infant but to a second unfortunate child, also a victim of Ptolemy's wrath. Hearing of the king's crime against his wife's son, the people deposed him and selected Cleopatra as their ruler. In retaliation, Ptolemy had his own son, also born of Cleopatra, murdered and sent the child's severed head and limbs to her during a banquet.",

Jugurtha was excluded from the line of succession by his grandfather's will, but his father raised him in the palace with his half-brothers the princes. Having proved his valor in military exploits, he was accepted as a legitimate heir to the throne and inherited a third of the kingdom. Greedy for the entire kingdom, he murdered his brothers to inherit their portions. His covetous nature, however, eventually led to his downfall. His own father-in-law recognized his ruthless nature and handed him over to the Romans, who took him as a captive and had him killed.",

A panel of marquetry showing the cockerel of France standing triumphant over both the eagle of the Holy Roman Empire and the lion of Spain and the Spanish Netherlands decorates the central door. On the drawer above the door, gilt-bronze military trophies flank a medallion portrait of Louis XIV. In the Dutch Wars of 1672 - 1678, France fought simultaneously against the Dutch, Spanish, and Imperial armies, defeating them all. This cabinet celebrates the Treaty of Nijmegen, which concluded the war. Two large figures from Greek mythology, Hercules and Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, representatives of strength and bravery in war, appear to support the cabinet.The fleurs-de-lis on the top two drawers indicate that the cabinet was made for Louis XIV. As it does not appear in inventories of his possessions, it may have served as a royal gift. The Sun King's portrait appears twice on this work. The bronze medallion above the central door was cast from a medal struck in 1661 which shows the king at the age of twenty-one. Another medallion inside shows him a few years later.The pair to this cabinet still exists in Scotland. Both cabinets probably entered England in the early nineteenth century after the French Revolution caused the dispersal of so many French collections.",

In this early example, the pendulum and weights have been enclosed in a long case for protection. The center of the narrow body swells to allow for the pendulum's swing, and it has a viewing hole to observe the movement.A phrase from Virgil engraved beneath the dial--Solem audet dicere falsum(It dares the Sun to tell a lie)--alludes to the accuracy of this type of clock and its ability to demonstrate the irregularity of the sun's orbit.On the basis of the marquetry pattern, the case can be attributed to the\u00e9b\u00e9nisteAndr\u00e9-Charles Boulle.

The commode became a very fashionable form of furniture during the 1700s.In addition to its three drawers (a long one on top and two smaller ones below), this commode contains several other, less obvious storage places. The large, central gilt bronze mount is attached to the front of a narrow drawer, and the two lower drawers each have a deep base that was once hidden by a false bottom. The swelled concave and convex form is fairly typical for the early 1700s. The heavy form and massive sculptural mounts on this piece are typical of the workmanship of Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle, one of the most famous Parisian\u00e9b\u00e9nistesin the early 1700s.",

Because of its expense and the impracticality of its vast size, this ambitious plan for the church of the Madeleine in Paris was never executed.After becoming an architect instead of a painter at the request of his father, Boull\u00e9e regularly managed to include small painterly details in his architectural drawings. Using gradations of washes, he effectively suggested the dramatic effect of sunlight entering through the central dome, illuminating the altar, and creating dark shadows behind the columns.

He painted gold stars against the deep blue night sky and gold rays piercing through the roof of the manger and extending to the infant. From the child emanate more golden rays that light up the interior of the building and illuminate the figures of Mary and Joseph, reflected as highlights on their clothing. Bourdichon carefully observed how light acts in the physical world, but he also endowed that light with a spiritual quality, indicating its heavenly origin.The miniature accompanies a verse from Psalm 69, which opens the prayers for Prime--as well as other hours--in the Hours of the Virgin:Deus in adiutorium meum intende. Domine ad adiuvandum me festina(God, come to my assistance. Lord, make haste to help me).",

Suddenly, the supernatural light of the angel in the sky overpowers the naturalistic source of light from the campfire.

This ceremonious and joyfulminiatureof theCoronation of the Virgin, an apocryphal event said to have occurred after her death, fittingly accompanies the last of the services of theHours of the Virgin, calledCompline. The text begins with verse five ofPsalm84:Converte nos deus salutaris n[oste]r et averte iram tuam a nobis(Convert us, God, our savior, and turn your anger from us).In this miniature Jean Bourdichon displayed his knowledge of the principles of Italian Renaissance painting, including the sophisticated use of symmetry and geometry for the composition. Bourdichon arranged the angels at the feet of the Virgin in an ellipse, but to offset the composition's symmetry, he twisted the axis of the crowning angels, further emphasizing the illusion of receding space. In this miniature, Bourdichon represented the divine light emanating from the Virgin as visible rays, which then softly model the draperies of the two angels and the faces of those below.",

In this scene, Bathsheba is transformed into the temptress of King David, lingering naked in her bath and gazing unabashedly out at the viewer. Her abundant blond hair glows on the page, and her high, small breasts, and broad hips accorded with the highest standards of feminine beauty of the time.

Gabriel, dressed in white with multi-colored wings, kneels and points towards the circular window above, indicating the presence of God.

The room at the left is simply described: a barrel ceiling, a marble column with two steps leading up to the room, and a stained glass window. A mood of solemnity, suitable for prayer, pervades the scene. In this somber setting Bouts's use of bright red for the drapery seems unusual. It may signify the Passion, forecasting the death of Christ, or it may be purely decorative since Bouts used this color in other compositions.The Annunciationbelongs to a set of five paintings that originally constituted a polyptych representing scenes from the life of Jesus Christ.

The unusual feature of this vase is the odd way the men are dressed. They wear longchitonsand turban-like headdresses, and attendants shelter them with parasols. Several dozen vases with similarly dressed revelers survive. Scholars call these scenes of men in fancy dress Anakreontic, after the poet Anakreon, who came to Athens from East Greece in the late 500s B.C. Scholars do not agree on how to interpret this costume. Because the men's clothing is similar to that of the women in the scene, some scholars see the men as transvestites dressing up as women. Other scholars point out that this clothing was suitable male attire in the Greek colonies on the coast of Turkey and in the neighboring kingdom of Lydia. They see the adoption of Eastern dress forsymposia, or drinking parties, as part of a larger infiltration of East Greek art and ideas into Athenian culture beginning in the 520s B.C. A quieter scene decorates the interior of the cup, with a young man offering a flower to a standing woman holding a mirror.",

Bristol's photographs were used extensively for casting when the book was made into a film in 1940.

Perhaps he used steps to gain a better view or made the study from a cast of the hand. He combined more than one view of the three-dimensional hand, including both the upper surface of the thumb and the bulging muscle along the lower contour of the hand, which in reality cannot be seen at the same time.

The troops had gathered on a mud-covered hillside, which they had used as a makeshift First Aid center while attempting to take areas known as Hills 400 and 484. While this image focuses on the bandaged, bloodied African-American soldier in the center, diagonally positioned limbs of men on the left side of the image direct attention to a mud-covered soldier lying injured on the ground.Photojournalist Larry Burrows framed this image in a manner that emphasizes an apocalyptic, scorched earth in the colors of brown and muted cyan. But there is a hint of vividness in the bright white, bloodstained bandage of a soldier centered in the picture. Prior to Vietnam, war images were typically made using black and white film, so Burrows use of color enhances the impact of this scene.More than any other war until then, the Vietnam conflict was brought to American citizens through the eyes of photojournalists. Their poignant and arresting imagery in magazines likeLifeandLook,television, and newspapers gave Americans an unromantic vision of daily warfare. Burrows and three other photojournalists lost their lives five years later when their helicopter was shot down en route to cover the war's expansion into Laos.",

Though even her horses shy away from the deed she is about to perform, Tullia seems determined to finish the job of completely destroying her father.Focusing on the horror of the scene--taken from the Roman historian Livy--Giuseppe Cades crammed the composition full of figures and movement. The horses rear, manes streaming out, and Tullia and her groom gesture at the body of Servius, their capes billowing in the wind. The use of white heightening, which illuminates the flowing mane and muscular body of the central horse and the murdered king's body, amplifies the dramatic effect of the darkened scene.Scholars believe that Cades made the drawing to be sold as an independent work of art rather than in preparation for a painting.

In this image, the composition incorporates a floating, floral-patterned cloth and plant reflections on the water. Depending on the attitude of the viewer, the human model in these dark images might express death or dreaming.",

In the wallpaper-pattern of a blue bamboo forest behind her, two yellow lovebirds flutter above her left shoulder and appear to be kissing with their small pointed beaks. By juxtaposing implied sensations, such as constriction and mobility (the ribbon and birds) and warm and cool (the colors of skin and foliage), Callis seems to sabotage traditional symbols.This photograph and similar ones were made after Callis' first exposure to the work of Paul Outerbridge, when the contents of his estate came to light in Los Angeles. Outerbridge's not-quite-natural color photographs inspired Callis to use color for her own expressive images. The erotic, fabricated vein running through his commercial and personal work convinced her that she was on the right path.",

From left to right, three images present individual items: a white cake on a glass plate, a light-grey Fedora hat, and a round, white pillow. Jo Ann Callis says ofCake, Hat, Pillow: \"I didn't want any one of the objects in the composition to be more important than any other, so I had to separate them and give each its own independent space. These particular subjects were selected because they look very similar in the way they are photographed--and in their shape--but their meanings are quite different from one another. Domestic objects fascinate me because we see them all the time and we have strong associations with them.\"Referring to the combined black-and-white still life studies made in 1982-83 asThe Gridseries, Callis selected familiar household objects that, individually, gave her comfort. By combining these objects and adding strong, focused overhead lighting, she infused drama or an imagined conversation, between the objects. The resulting assemblages cause the viewer to give common objects new weight and, perhaps, new meaning.",

How one appears to the outside world may be different from what one feels internally.--Jo Ann CallisIn the mid-1980s, Jo Ann Callis created a series of images that featured human figures in movement. The anonymity of the people in these fictitious scenes enables viewers to identify with them and share their seeming conflict or anxiety. The scenes she created were often domestic, and the models were dressed to carry out seemingly ordinary routines. Occasionally taking this idea of performance photography to its logical extreme, she asked her models to do magic or sideshow tricks in highly theatrical sets featuring spotlighting, heavy gold drapery, and purple backdrops. In this example, Callis invented what she called a \"kind of metaphor for life.\" Her young model has the agility to do a handstand with no apparent strain, yet her intent, Callis says, was to have the woman \"look as if she were at ease while at the same time . . . performing something that is difficult for her to carry off.\"",

The streaming mane and tail and the unusual vertical format emphasize the upward movement of the rearing horse.Upon completing the large stallion, Callot returned to the quill pen to execute the tiny equine figure in the lower right.

The complexity and urgency of the process led to many technical mistakes, and Cameron's early attempts were no exception.

Cameron photographed Watts frequently and in different guises. Here she cast him in the role of musician with hismuseor guiding spirit looking intently over his left shoulder, as though she is \"whispering\" some artistic encouragement in his ear. He, in turn, looks down upon the figure of the child on his right, who appears to be entranced by his violin playing.The violin is the visual focus of the composition and establishes a connection between the visual and performing arts. The concept of \"muse\" derives from Greek mythology and indicates the influence ofclassicalsources in Cameron's work. On the mount board under this image, her inscription, \"a Triumph!,\" demonstrates the degree to which she felt this photograph captured the relationship of artist and muse.",

Magdalene Brookfield, a family friend of Julia Margaret Cameron, is the dark-haired woman strolling through this garden. Her pyramid-shaped figure is centered in the photograph, and so is Cameron's focus. Brookfield's face, hand, and a part of a nearby bush are sharply defined. The rest of the image blends into soft-focus, emphasizing her mysterious, pointing gesture.Perhaps Magdalene represents the subject of a man's obsession, as in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's 1855 poem, Maud, in which the ephemeral qualities of love and a woman's beauty are ascribed to nature. Like Eve in the Garden of Eden, the woman in nature becomes part of a moral theme of the virtuous woman versus the fallen woman. Cameron probably made this outdoor, full-figure study at the London home of her sister, Sara Prinsep.",

Cameron composed this image around the sitter's downcast eyes and scrolling hair--which spills out from under a turban. Cameron's niece, May Prinsep, plays the role of Beatrice, the central figure of Percy Bysshe Shelley's play, The Cenci (1819). Prinsep's sorrowful expression conveys the character's resignation to her fate.Beatrice Cenci, the daughter of a Roman count, lived in Florence during the late 1500s. After Beatrice conspired with her mother and brother to have her father killed, the trial brought to light his cruelty, which included an attempt to rape her. Although the story won public sympathy, the family was nonetheless executed. Cameron was fascinated by this true story and made several photographic studies based on it.",

Herschel was not only a preeminent astronomer but also made several significant discoveries in photographic processes, most notably the invention of thecyanotypeblueprint.Even before she began to make photographs, Cameron kept apprised of discoveries in photography through her correspondence with Herschel. In this portrait of her dear friend, Cameron sought to portray \"faithfully the greatness of the inner as well as the features of the outer man.\" Cameron draped Herschel in a swath of dark cloth, which served to highlight his white hair and to focus attention on his face.

She had to wait long and patiently, however, for the chance to capture the historian Thomas Carlyle with her lens. Carlyle, famous for writingOn Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History, sat for Cameron only once, and during the sitting she made two photographs: this frontal portrait and a profile view.Carlyle's face is cast in deep shadow. The dramatic lighting, which both illuminates and obscures his face, gives the portrait an emotional intensity. Carlyle was an intellectual hero to Cameron. Believing she had successfully captured him in a heroic posture, Cameron inscribed some prints of this image with the caption: \"Carlyle like a rough block of Michelangelo's sculpture.\" This powerful, head-on view reveals a strength and intensity of character that mirrors the straightforward, sometimes antagonistic discourses in his writing.",

He then arranged combinations of putti, human figures, trailing foliage, and bucrania around each form.Artists designed such intricate candelabra not just as functional objects like candle or torch supports; they also appeared as decorative motifs. Such forms ornamented the margins of printed books and filled the edges of frescoes. Parallel hatched lines down the sides of each candelabrum in this drawing give each form a sense of depth. But the clarity of the lines also suggests that the drawings could have transferred for engravings.

A crescent visible below her skirts at the left symbolizes the moon on which the Virgin stands in representations of the Immaculate Conception. The open and closed books symbolize the Old and New Testaments, and the lilies to the right symbolize Mary's purity. The apple in Christ's hands and mouth alludes to original sin and his future sacrifice.In this painting, the artist preserves the rich colors and detailed focus of his predecessors, theilluminated manuscriptpainters, while attempting to create a coherent spatial world. The river winds into the background, yet the townscape in the distance is rendered with as much clarity as the trim on the Virgin's drapery. Minutely observed details demonstrate the early Netherlandish interest in creating a convincing illusion of three-dimensional reality on a flat panel.",

This view of the north side of Saint Mark's Square features its celebrated clock tower, topped by bronze figures that strike the hours. Yet the church bells on the far right actually belong to a rooftop two buildings away. By moving the bells to the side of the drawing, Canaletto emphasized the receding perspective. He frequently distorted and rearranged monuments to suit his refined sense of composition.Canaletto probably enlisted the aid of a camera obscura, a ruler, and a compass to produce this sketch, reworking it later in his studio. He often referred to drawings for guidance and inspiration. He may also have used this sketch as a pattern for a larger painting from his workshop. Canaletto left many notes on the sketch, including one to remind himself of the drawing he made on the verso--a market scene of elegant gentlemen mingling with vendors among an array of merchandise.",

For a brief time in the 1740s, he painted scenes of contemporary life set around the principal monuments of ancient Rome, based either on drawings made during an earlier visit to Rome or on engravings by other artists. Both groups of his views appealed to the traveler as well as the antiquarian.Seen through the central bay of the Arch of Constantine is the Colosseum, which Canaletto shifted to the left in the interests of compositional design. Figures converse, stroll, or carry out daily chores in the vicinity of these ancient buildings. To the left, a lone man sits on ruins with his back to the viewer, perhaps sketching or writing. Wealthy tourists and their servants laden with goods contrast with the poor Roman natives who have nothing, such as the woman who lies against the Arch or the man with a cane at the right. In this painting, Canaletto seems to remark on the gulf between Rome's ancient glory and the city's current impoverished state.",

Although the strong horizontal line of the architecture forms the focus of the drawing as it divides earth from sky, Canaletto also filled the scene with many intricate details. A huntsman walks across the courtyard, dressed in a long frock coat and three-cornered hat, his rifle slung over one shoulder and his dog trotting beside him. A couple stand conversing against the back wall, while another woman in a full skirt and white apron enjoys the sunshine underneath the tower on the right. The rooftops of the city below can be glimpsed through the arched gateway of the central gate. These small details not only give a sense of the wall's great height but also humanize the scene.Canaletto probably made this drawing as a preparatory study for a subsequent painting of the same subject.

In his representation of one of these women, sculptor Antonio Canova suggested her innocence through the austerity and sparseness of theNeoclassicalstyle, drawing on the contemporary idea thatclassicalforms carry with them the expression of a strict morality. Thebustis made of simple geometric shapes: a square for the bust and oval for the face. The tightly wound headcovering pulls in her hair and, with the cloak, draws attention to the purity of the shapes. Her firm shoulders and uninhibited, unmoving stare further suggest her resolve, innocence, and moral authority. Despite her physical beauty and the softness of the folds of the cloak, the statue does not invite touching. It is a cool, intellectual work of simple forms and restrained emotion.With the discovery of the so-called House of the Vestals inPompeii, Vestal Virgins became a popular subject in the 1700s and 1800s.

Now, on June 6th, 1944, it was the ugliest beach in the whole world ... I took out my second Contax camera and began to shoot without raising my head.\"-- Robert CapaUnder heavy fire, photographer Robert Capa swam ashore along with American soldiers on D-Day in World War II, making images of their successful yet deadly attempt to establish a beachhead in France. While troops around him aimed their guns at enemy forces above the beach, Capa aimed his camera at them, capturing the soldiers' bravery and the battle's intensity. Because Capa was standing in the water with them, the camera angle provides a sense of the chaos of war that soldiers surely felt on that day.Although Capa shot 72 images that day, all but eleven were ruined when the negatives were placed in an overheated film drying cabinet in a London lab. The images that survived appear grainy and blurry, partly due to this error, and partly due to Capa's nerves. Despite the damage, the effect appears almost intentional--as a visual metaphor for the confusing experience of combat. As with many of his war photographs, this image exemplifies Capa's oft-quoted philosophy, \"If your pictures aren't good enough, you aren't close enough.\"",

A bearded Greek philosopher in theforegroundlooks at the sky and points to an armillary sphere on the ground. Next to him, the central figure,Dionysius the Areopagite, holds a book, points to the sky, and looks at the celestial globe carried by the figure running up the steps at the right. Dionysius preaches the Christian message of salvation to pagan Greek philosophers. Aputto, seated on the steps between a square and straight edge, writes on a tablet, recording the event.In thebackgroundon the right, a statue representingUrania, themuseof Astronomy, stands on a twisted column.

The Carracci brothers began work on the decoration of the Galleria Farnese in Rome, including this fresco, in 1597. For centuries, this cycle of paintings influenced artists as much as Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling.Beginning with drawing from life and understanding anatomy, the Carracci focused on painting the human figure. Their drawings of the nude maintained monumental proportions while broadly sketching the body's essential structure; combining robust energy with soft, rhythmic contours.The fragment of an arm on the verso of this drawing was trimmed from a study of a triton now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, proving that this sheet was once part of a larger one.",

Thick, charcoal-black lines delineate rippling muscles and slightly enlarged limbs. White-chalk highlights create the illusion that parts of the body project forward in space, adding a sense of three-dimensionality. Red chalk on Christ's hands and feet creates further naturalistic details by suggesting flesh tones.Although Carre\u00f1o's rough drawing style is distinctly Spanish, the combination of charcoal and red and white chalk reflects the strong influence of Renaissance Venetian art on seventeenth-century Spanish artists.

Castiglione \"drew\" with the brush in oils, using little color and thus conveying the effect of a drawing rather than a painting.

He altered the saint's cap to a cardinal's hat and reduced the drapery in the lower left, part of which originally fell outside the edge of the niche, so that it would fit within the design.

Instead, he limited the figure's goat-like features to the face, which displays protruding horns and a savage, animal-like expression that Cellini described as \"fiery and menacing, instilling fear into the beholders.\" Cellini designed this and a similar figure to flank the monumental entrance of Porte Dor\u00e9e, the royal palace atFontainebleau.

With the Christ child on her lap, Mary is approached by young Saint John the Baptist and his mother, the Virgin's cousin Saint Elizabeth. The elderly Elizabeth helps her son along as he walks toward Jesus to offer him a globe, a sign of Christ's role as savior of the world. Two small boys, possibly angels, accompany the group. At the center of the relief, a prominently placed tree likely signifies the Tree of Life.The relief may have formed part of a larger sculptural complex, although it would also have been appropriate for an altar. Because of the rarity of its subject and its extraordinarily high quality, it is also possible that the relief stood on its own as a devotional image in a private chapel.",

        "description": "When a jury member at the ParisSalonof 1866 first saw Paul C\u00e9zanne's portrait of the journalist and critic Antony Valabr\u00e8gue, he exclaimed that the portrait was not painted with a knife but with a pistol. Although the Salon refused him admission, C\u00e9zanne continued to paint many portraits of his friend, including the present example, thought to have been painted around 1869 to 1871.For this painting, C\u00e9zanne used a palette knife rather than brushes. With the spatula-like instrument, he applied paint in thick, successive layers, giving the surface a complex, rough-and-smooth texture. He then used the knife to squeeze the paints together so that they mixed directly on the canvas. In this fashion C\u00e9zanne moved the paint around, eliminating contour lines and instead creating impastoed areas of color, as if sculpting in paint. In another portrait of his friend made four years earlier, the coarse, almost violent appearance created by C\u00e9zanne's technique led Valabr\u00e8gue to complain in a letter to the writer Zola: \"He has given me such a fierce complexion that it reminds me of the statue of Champfleury when it was stained with squashed blackberries.\"",

This woman is confronted by devotees from different arts and occupations, among them a miteredbishop, whose admiration seems intrusive, even aggressive. A painter sometimes identified as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix stands at his easel painting the scene. The bald figure at the painting's bottom may be C\u00e9zanne himself. Whether she encourages their adoration, passively accepts it, or is trapped by her cult is unclear. Like many of C\u00e9zanne's nudes, the woman's face is nearly blank, except for her red eye sockets.

His interest was not in the objects themselves but in using them to experiment with shape, color, and lighting. He arranged his still lifes so that everything locked together. Edges of objects run into each other; for example, a black arabesque seemingly escapes from the blue cloth to capture an apple in the center; the sinuous curves of the blue ginger pot's rattan straps merge with other straps on the body of the bottle behind.

Although the groupings seem casual, C\u00e9zanne is known to have taken great care with the arrangement, sometimes spending hours positioning the objects.In this brightly colored watercolor, C\u00e9zanne's monumental conception of form is evident: the jug, the two pots, one white, one blue, and the seven apples assume a physical presence beyond normal perception of their existence. Using small patches of color laid next to one another, C\u00e9zanne evoked the plasticity of substance, building form rather like bricks build structures. His fresh and vigorous brushstrokes are visible against the background wall as areas of greens and blues are juxtaposed. The apples are described with red arcs around the perimeter, then yellow brushstrokes next to the red; the empty middle suggests light reflecting off the surface.

In still lifes, genre scenes, and the occasional portrait, Chardin's skill at rendering the visual and tactile qualities of simple objects won him the admiration of critics like Diderot.In this small still life, Chardin portrayed a modest subject--three walnuts, four peaches, two bunches of grapes, and a pewter mug--but gave the objects monumentality by arranging them in pure geometric groupings and concentrating on their basic forms. He suggested the objects' various textures and substances through the play of light across surfaces and successive applications of paint. In this way, Chardin conveyed the fuzzy skin of the peaches, the hard, brittle shell of the walnuts, the translucence of the grapes, and the heavy, cold exterior of the pewter mug.",

Many artists argued that photographs could not be considered art because they were made with a mechanical device and chemicals rather than by human hand and spirit. These individuals did however see photography as a useful way to eliminate the drudgery of studying from a live model. Figures posed in studio settings soon became a popular subject.

In their desire for tangible luxury products, many wealthy patrons commissioned sumptuously illuminated books of hours.The complete Varie Hours, of which the Getty Museum's volume is only a part, includes forty-nine large miniatures and several dozen other vignettes and historiated initials by four different artists. While three of these painters are anonymous, Varie commissioned the internationally sought-after painter Jean Fouquet to make six of the manuscript's illuminations; these were appended to the book as an unusual frontispiece. A later owner divided the book into three volumes. The Getty Museum owns one, and the two others belong to the Royal Library in The Hague, The Netherlands.",

Aryballoi with modeled heads of humans and animals seem to be a specialty of this workshop; they were probably related to plastic vases, which were popular in the mid-600s B.C.

To make this love theme explicit, the artist used symbolic props such as the putti on the sides of the bed. The putto on the right represents earthly/sensual love, while the one on the left, with his eyes bound shut, represents heavenly/spiritual love.

The battle of Herakles and Triton first appeared in Greek art about 565 B.C. and was especially popular in the period from about 530 to 510 B.C. No ancient author recorded the story of Herakles and Triton. This lack of literary sources for the depiction and the fact that it appears almost exclusively in Athenian art has led some scholars to look for a special meaning in the scene. The mythological battle may have had symbolic political significance for the Athenians. The tyrants who ruled Athens in this period, Peisistratos and his sons, may have adopted Herakles as their symbol; and the scene may refer to a naval victory of Athens over her neighboring enemy, the city-state of Megara.",

By immediately rendering his observations in paint, Closson developed his skill at reproducing nature's myriad, constantly shifting colors. He used the oil paint's thickness and saturated, opaque colors to invest the simple leaves with a powerful visual impact.The butterburr, also known as bog rhubarb, has enormous leaves, which Closson showed in varying phases, from verdant green to withered purplish-brown. At the center, a leaf is beginning to change color, midway between life and death. Closson's choice of a close viewpoint and monumental treatment of what might otherwise seem a trivial subject lead the viewer to contemplate the cyclical nature of life.

Both the government and private owners of railroads commissioned photographs to attract new investors to the transportation system; theChemin de Fer du Bourbonnais(Bourbonnais Railway Company) assigned Hippolyte-Auguste Collard to make this photograph, an interior view of a roundhouse, a building for servicing and housing locomotives. Roundhouses were less efficient than rectangular buildings because of their single rotating center slab that moved the locomotives into their berths. But that fact would never be deduced from this gleaming, orderly interior, a model of efficiency.Each identical engine aligns perfectly with the hood that draws the steam from the pipe, thus keeping the building clear of poisonous carbon monoxide fumes. Using awide-angle lens, Collard has photographed the scene to maximize the room's spatial configuration, and in doing so he has flattened theperspective. The engines appear to be miniatures: only the door visible at the lower center edge between two engines gives an indication of the interior's actual scale and the technical feat that Collard achieved in rendering such a sweeping view.",

Although the absolute symmetry of the bridge and light posts is compelling and might have attracted another photographer, Hippolyte-Auguste Collard made a less obvious choice, positioning his camera at the end of the Point du Jour, slightly off-center and toward the middle of the right pedestrian arcade. This view establishes an unobstructed line of sight to a point in the far distance, making the viaduct seem infinite. The shadowy sweep of the bridge overhead fans out of the frame like a lopsided crown, while a puddle of water just in front of the left pedestrian passageway, whose arch bears the stains of seeping water, suggests a more mundane problem threatening the impressive structure.",

By liberally laying in white chalk, Corneille created a sensuous play of light over the Christ Child's skin and described the diaphanous fabric loosely draped around the fleshy infant's body. To further heighten the brilliance of the red and white chalks, he chose blue paper as his support. The combination of red, white, and black chalk is a technique known by French term coined in the 1700s,aux trois crayons.On the verso, Corneille drew theMadonna and Child with Saint John Seated in a Landscapein pen and ink, suggesting tonal areas with brownwashand black chalk.

Beginning with Saint Paul of Thebes and Saint Anthony of Egypt in the 200s, Christian monks retreated to this region, to live a solitary life of ascetism and prayer. Over time, these monks, also known as \"desert fathers,\" organized into communities.Costa's scratchy, energetic draftmanship created a bustling composition filled with monks and a landscape riddled with the grottoes, huts, and caves they used for prayer and shelter. He portrayed an imaginary scene, incorporating a variety of monastic saints and spanning different periods. In the upper left background, Saints Paul and Anthony are shown seated, receiving bread from a raven through which God provided nourishment. Mary Magdalene, who supposedly lived her later years alone in the desert, stands near the river to the right. The landscape itself appears more European than Egyptian, perhaps reflecting Costa's native countryside around Bologna, Italy, rather than the real Thebaid.",

Also in a historicizing vein, his younger brother John wears a dress, traditionally worn by both boys and girls until they reached four years of age, and holds a wicker basket full of colorful summer blossoms. Francis Cotes captured his sitters with disarming directness. Joseph bears himself gracefully and engages the viewer with his gaze, yet he still retains the fragile self-reserve typical of an older boy. His brother John, however, caught in three-quarter view, moves and smiles with the unselfconscious spontaneity of a four-year-old.

Courbet contributed a sense of psychological complexity to the drawing by depicting her in dark shadows.This richly toned drawing illustrates Courbet's disdain for the clean lines prescribed by the French Academy. He preferred to use thick deposits of cont\u00e9 crayon, vigorously smudged, to create texture and convey mood. This monumental life-sized drawing, like many of his paintings, was meant to create a jolting visual impact.

Intending to visit his friend Etienne Baudry for two weeks, he arrived at the garden enthusiast's ch\u00e2teau in May and remained in the area for eleven months. With his friend's encouragement, Courbet explored flower painting using Baudry's extensive gardens, greenhouses, and library of botanical books. He painted about twenty flower pictures and remarked to a friend, \"I am coining money out of flowers.\"Courbet had visited Holland in 1847 and his exposure there to Dutch flower painting is evident. His arrangement shares the exuberant spontaneity and abundance of Dutch artist Jan Van Huysum'sVase of Flowers.Like his Netherlandish forebears, Courbet chose flowers that bloom at different times of the year: lilies, roses, gladioli, stock, asters, ipomoeas, poppies, and others. While he typically eschewedallegory, Courbet may have also followed the Dutch practice of using ephemeral flowers to suggest the transitory nature of life and human happiness. Unlike Van Huysum and other Dutch painters known for their intricately detailed technique, Courbet used broad brushstrokes and often spread his thick paint with apaletteknife.",

In this disreputable game of cards, the woman decides which card to play by examining her opponent's cards, which she sees in a mirror held up behind her opponent's back by her accomplice. At the right, another woman with a broken pipe at her feet drinks wine and smokes, while a man relieves himself against the wall. A seated child wearing a kind of turban plays on the floor. The woman with the straw hat and the bearded man, colored with great refinement, are characteristic types in Craesbeeck's repertory of figures. Possibly influenced by Caravaggio's followers, Craesbeeck paid careful attention to the effects of light, which streams into the room from a single window.",

Using numerous delicate lines, he built up the long flowing mane, the smooth coat, and the tufted tail. This drawing provided the inspiration for the lion in a laterwoodcut, although Cranach changed the coat and mane to make them more shaggy and curly.Exotic animals such as lions, tigers, and elephants were extremely rare in Europe in the 1500s. Although members of the aristocracy kept some in private zoos or menageries, artists mainly had to rely on prints or stuffed examples if they wished to include an exotic beast in their works. It is thus unlikely that Cranach drew this lion from life, despite its lively, lopsided expression.",

        "description": "Lucas Cranach the Elder drew from both native German andclassicalliterary sources to depict a family offaunsin a woodland clearing. Although the precise subject of this painting remains obscure, it recalls the legendary \"wild man\" found in medieval mythology, as well as idyllic forest dwellers, such as fauns, described in Greek poetry.The male faun sits on a rock, staff in hand, with a slain lion at his feet. He gazes toward a woman--presumably his wife--and their children. Dark foliage mediates between them and a stunning landscape: a lake, a village, mountains, and a castle in the distance. Isolated and protected from civilization, these figures represent the wild traits of mankind. On the other hand, the faun's humanlike appearance, the woman's calm demeanor, and the baby's tender gesture suggest more civilized aspects of society.Aside from this broadernarrative, Cranach's finely worked style draws attention to incidental elements, such as the lion's fur and a man and a horse and cart climbing the castle-topped mountain. The lion's stylized body fits perfectly in the painting's lower left corner. Such attention to detail and Cranach's complex subject matter appealed to the refined tastes of his learned, courtlypatrons.",

The gleaming white highlights of the oil paint in the face contrast with the brown ground, making the sitter seem to emerge from the shadows and enhancing the illusion of his living presence; the young man's large, intelligent eyes further the effect. Cranach combined intensity of expression with jewel-like refinement of surfaces to create a memorable image.To produce the brownish ground, Cranach rubbed the paper with oil. He then sketched in the outlines of the head in pen and ink, meticulously going over the eyebrows, lashes, and outer facial contours. Next, using black chalk and brown oil paint, he sketched in the hat and collar. He continued by working up the face in oil paint, meticulously establishing the nuanced contours of the man's facial structure.",

He succumbed to the plague that same year and soon became the object of religious devotion. An abbot from Bernard's monastic order commissioned this painting in 1736, when Bernard was being considered for sainthood. Giuseppe Maria Crespi interpreted the story's pathos with great depth, expression, and immediacy.Wearing a white robe and holding a crucifix, Bernard and a fellow monk attend to plague victims in an open-air encampment outside the walls of Siena. On the left, a priest walks under an umbrella, accompanied by an acolyte. Several plague-stricken figures languish on the ground in various stages of death. Below Bernard, a woman slumps over while her small child desperately tries to pull her upright. At her feet, the foreshortened body of a dead infant falls in the area between the acolyte and bowing monk. A woman has perished in the right corner, her gray-skinned body lifeless, thus a man above her holds a cloth over his mouth to avoid smelling the stench.

His practice of casting bronze in his workshop broke strict guild rules; through the eighteenth century, the craft of casting and gilding bronze was restricted to a separate guild. Cressent was fined several times for these infringements; in order to pay the penalties, he was forced to hold sales of his stock. In a catalogue he wrote in 1756 for one such sale, he describes this commode's unique central gilt-bronze mount: \"the bronzes [represent] two children who are grating snuff; in the middle is a monkey powdering itself with snuff.\"By the time it was built, this commode already looked old-fashioned. By the 1740s most commodes were constructed without a central divider that separated the two drawers. Although the curving gilt-bronze branches on the front try to mask this division, Cressent had to split the mount into three pieces--an awkward solution. He seems to have had difficulty selling the commode as it was still in his possession nearly twenty years after its construction.",

The simple, dramatic composition and statuesque main figures give this small, slightly eerie, moonlit scene a monumental quality. Yet the rhythm from the flowing movement and patterns of the garments enlivens the rocky desert setting and prevents the composition from being purely static.Richard Dadd's lightenedpalette, fascination with detail, and interest in decorative patterning typify mid-1800s English painting. For authenticity, Dadd selectedmotifsfrom Egyptian wallreliefs, Roman sculpture, his own memories, and possibly his own travel sketches of the desert and cliffs near the Dead Sea.To show this Old Testament subject, rarely seen in Victorian painting, Dadd mixed historical events, modern passions, and perhaps personal associations. After delusions led him to kill his father in 1843, he continued making art while confined to a mental hospital. Thinking that Dadd might cultivate David's moral virtues as an antidote to his own murderous compulsions, his doctor may even have suggested this subject.",

On the left panel Saint Thomas Aquinas wears the Dominican habit and holds a book of his writings. On the right panel, Saint Paul turns toward the Virgin and holds his symbol of martyrdom, the sword. In the center, the Virgin Mary wears a deep rich blue cloak made from ultramarine or lapis lazuli, a very precious and expensive pigment. A pattern of intricate marks called tooling, punched into the gold, defines the halo around her head. The background of the panels is covered with a thin layer of gold leaf, but the impression is of solid gold, meant to honor the holy figures depicted.As if she is extending into our space, the Virgin Mary reaches over the marble parapet with her right hand. This gesture symbolizes the holy Mother's power and mercy, and her unique position to serve for man as a compassionate link to God.During the 1500s, a reclining Christ Child was added in oil at the bottom, in front of the parapet.

Emulating Fragonard's manner of sketching on canvas, Daumier made her dress shimmer, drawing with his brush to build the lights cascading from her blouse onto her full skirt.Aside from touches of gestural brushwork on the man's sleeve, the model's hair, and the woman's brilliantly illuminated skin and dress, this painting's darkerpaletteand largely subdued brushwork are consistent with Daumier's usual style.

The composition follows the traditional model for Christ in Majesty, with Christ seated on the arc of heaven and within a mandorla. He holds a chalice over which the host hovers, a reference to the celebration of the Eucharist. The stylized rays of light that emanate from Christ's form create a direct contrast to the subtle modeling of the folds of his robes and sensitively painted hands and face. The eagle, man, lion, and ox placed in the corners are symbols of the four evangelists, John, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, respectively. Each holds a scroll inscribed with the corresponding saint's name.This leaf is one of the finest paintings by Antoine de Lonhy, who was active in the Savoy region of France in the 1400s. The leaf that faced it in the original manuscript depicts the Crucifixion and is now in Prague.",

Dutch artist Adriaen de Vries based thecompositionof this bronze statue on a famousHellenisticmarble of a dancingfaun, which Michelangelo was believed to have restored while it was in the collection of theMediciin Florence. Although de Vries borrowed the original statue's composition, he replaced the faun's foot organ with a bellows and substituted plates for the faun's cymbals.This work of artistic virtuosity combines vitality and movement with balance. The strong S-curve on the figure's back demonstrates the complexity of his balancing act. The artist may also have had in mind the German wordkunstst\u00fcckemachen,which means both to juggle and, more literally, to make a work of art.

The bearded saint sits in front of a barren and rocky background, his emaciated body a testament to his ascetic life. He directs his gaze to a crucifix that he holds in his left hand. During his time of religious contemplation, Saint Jerome was tormented by vivid hallucinations; his right hand clasps a rock with which he would beat his breast until the visions passed. A nook in the vaulted structure behind him holds his attributes: a cardinal's hat and a book referring to his translation of the Bible into Latin. A small lion inside the shelter recalls the fable in which Jerome pulls a thorn from a lion's paw, forever securing the animal's devotion. Ercole de'Roberti was artist to the court of Ferrara in northern Italy. The elongated forms, taut, linear rhythms, subtle colors, and meticulous, gold-flecked details of this painting convey the sophistication prized by Ercole's aristocratic patrons.

The sea goat carries Venus through the frothy waves, carved with energy and precision.John Deare displayed his great skill in carving a variety of levels and textures in this sculpture, from the low relief of the Cupid and putti to the smooth, half-relief of Venus, and finally to the sea-goat's fully three-dimensional snout and wavy strands of hair.

The small-scale, informal presentation and lightness of touch emphasize the intimacy of this image and the still-tentative character of the young artist.Around 1857, when he was twenty-three or twenty-four, Degas traveled to Italy, where he spent much of his time making copies afterRenaissancemasters. The period was one of self-education and he drew prolifically, writing in one of his notebooks, \"I must thoroughly realize I know nothing at all; it is the only way to get ahead.\" Finding in himself a willing sitter, he made fifteen or more self-portraits in various media during his time in Italy.",

Her languorous expression and red-rimmed eyes, together with the limp right arm hanging at her side, suggest a physical or emotional malady, though nothing in the painting confirms the cause of her affliction.

The painting is unconventional in other ways as well;The Convalescentis more psychologically suggestive and spatially ambiguous than typical portraits of the time, such as Franz Xaver Winterhalter's official portrait,Leonilla, Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn.Degas's thick, unblended brushstrokes and flattened space bring the figure forward, conveying informality and intimacy.",

The other two lean forward, absorbed in the developing relationship between the composer and the woman ironing.

Her strength and concentration are conveyed by the diagonal sweep formed by her outstretched arms. The gestural strokes surrounding her body echo this diagonal. Degas's colorpaletteheightens the dramatic effect; shades of electric blue contrast powerfully with Miss Lala's brown skin punctuated by a shock of black hair.Miss Lala performed her feats of strength and agility at the Fernando Circus, which opened in northern Paris in 1875. The Circus was a popular destination for artists. In addition to Degas--who lived nearby--Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Georges Seurat, each attended and painted the Circus. Degas was especially captivated by Miss Lala's arresting act and sketched her on successive nights in January 1879. This important study inpastelis one of several preparatory drawings that culminated in the artist's celebrated oil painting of Miss Lala's performance now in theNational Gallery, London. The pastel also reveals Degas's working process. For example, numerous pentimenti--especially in the thighs and right hand--show that Degas made adjustments to Miss Lala's pose on paper as she dangled above him.",

An early practitioner ofRealism, Degas captured women engaged in mundane tasks--laundresses ironing, prostitutes waiting for clients, and, most frequently, women bathing.The intimate subject of this painting, a woman bathing in a private interior, is one that invites voyeurism. Degas depicted the woman lying on a divan, while her maid dries or combs her hair. With her back pushed to the extremeforegroundof the images, she seems to hold the viewer at bay. Bracing herself with her left arm, the woman uncomfortably raises her left leg against the edge of the bathtub. Such unnatural poses have perplexed critics of Degas's time, as they do viewers today. Some see these poses as an attempt to depict human movement not in idealized forms, but in ordinary, private behavior. Others see such representations of women as misogynistic.",

On visits to Delacroix's studio twenty years later, Sand admired the new, rectangular painting of the subject the artist was working on. That canvas was promised to another admirer, so Delacroix made this nearly identical pastel for her and wrote to Sand's son, Maurice, informing him of the gift.Highly educated in the classics, Delacroix depicted subjects from antiquity throughout his life. Like his compatriot Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Delacroix used ancient marble sculptures as his source but to entirely different effect.

In an instant, homes have been reduced to rubble; incongruously colorful shards are littered with clothing, personal effects, and debris. In the distance, the few remaining palm trees underscore the fact that everything else in the scene has been flattened, razed, destroyed. At the photograph's center, a single man embodies the tsunami's human toll. This despondent figure looks over the remains of his home, searching for anything salvageable and, most of all, remembering lives lost.French photographer Luc Delahaye took this photograph in early January 2005--about ten days after the Indian Ocean earthquake that triggered a series of devastating tsunamis across Southeast Asia. Delahaye had first arrived in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh; but finding the international press concentrated there, he traveled southeast to Meulaboh. In this photograph, he focuses his camera on a part of the city closest to the seashore and worst hit by the tsunami. From a distant, frontal point of view, his camera records the scene with detail and accuracy and includes an unusual peripheral vision that reveals destruction as far as the eye can see.Beginning in 2001 with the Afghanistan war, Delahaye initiated a series of large-scale photographs featuring significant events of recent history. On one hand, these detailed, frontal works relate to the tradition of documentary photography. On the other, their size and narrative power evoke nineteenth-century European painting.

Two putti pull at the wings of a second eagle that carries a pair of entwined spouts on its back. This fanciful scene is a design for a glass cup and is explained in the inscription at the bottom of the sheet: white wine should be poured into one tube and red wine into the other, so that the red wine fills the eagles and snakes, and the white wine fills the rest.Stefano della Bella began this work by creating a preliminary sketch in black chalk. He then worked the sketch using a finely sharpened quill pen. Avoiding hard outlines, della Bella used tiny hair-like strokes for the contours to define the forms. A blue wash evokes the presence of liquid inside a transparent shell.Della Bella made this design for a member of the Medici family in Florence. Elaborate glass table ornaments were common at the Medici court and often accompanied ceremonial banquets. However, this drawing's complexity suggests that a goblet constructed to its fantastic design never graced the tabletop at a Medici feast. Instead, it served as an example of artistic ingenuity, admired by the patron as proof of della Bella's imaginative powers.",

Denis' confident paint handling and sensitive rendering of light capture the awe-inspiring power of nature. Using a warm palette, he juxtaposed light and dark tones to imply both the clouds' airy buoyancy and moisture-laden heaviness. Lively brushstrokes convey the constantly shifting forces of wind and light.This dramatic cloudscape predates by a century the Impressionists' celebration of outdoor landscape painting in which they recorded specific, yet fleeting, effects of weather and time and exhibited those results as finished paintings. But in Denis' time, oil sketching on paper while outdoors offered the artist an opportunity to test and sharpen his skills. Denis would have kept his cloud studies in the studio for future reference for his finished paintings.",

At the top of the work, balancing on a thin black pin, fancifully cut forms interconnect to create a roughly circular shape.

But viewed as a single object, the piece takes on an almost poetic wholeness. This unity is enhanced by the works kinetic properties. With the thick black beam serving as an essential counterbalance, many of the piece's surfaces can be set in gentle motion by the lightest touch or breeze. Despite variations in size and shape, the forms move in the same time and rhythm.\"Gandy dancer\" is a slang term for a railroad maintenance worker originating in the late 1800s. Gandy dancer crews were known for accompanying their laborious, repetitive work with singing and dancing.

As the general leads his cavalry into the city, trampling a child underfoot, he receives the homage of the population in the person of the bearded man kneeling to the left, who offers a platter containing three utensils, perhaps representing the keys of the city.Jos\u00e9 Xim\u00e9nez Donoso copied the equestrian figure from a well-known etching by Jusepe de Ribera but added soldiers and spectators to thebackground.

While carefully depicting the town of Saumur's landmarks, he added local citizens and animals to give the vista a picturesque effect.

Ha!\" quoth he, \"full plain I see,The Devil knows how to row.\"--Samuel Taylor Coleridge, fromThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner.Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poemThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerrecounts the tale of a young mariner's supernatural adventures at sea. This watercolor is a study for one of thirty-eight images that artist Gustave Dor\u00e9 created to illustrate editions of the poem published in 1875 and 1876.This scene takes place near the end of the poem (lines 564-569), after the Mariner is forever cursed for shooting an albatross. This slaughter triggers a curse that causes the death of the Mariner's entire crew, forcing him to navigate the seas alone for seven days and nights.This image illustrates the moment the masts of Mariner's ship disappear into a mighty white froth, shown at the center left. A pilot and his son have just rescued the Mariner, but thought him dead. When the Mariner instead takes the oars, as seen here at center, the men think he is the Devil and go insane. Dor\u00e9 depicts one of them slumped at the base of the picture frame, behind the Mariner. The other lolls over the right side of the boat. The dark, austere figure of the Holy Hermit, looms at the top right of the boat, perhaps signaling the misery awaiting the Mariner on shore, where he will be doomed to wander the earth for eternity to tell his story as penance.Dor\u00e9's varied watercolor techniques and the work's large size both serve the drama of the poem.The waves, in their gloomy palette and multiple washes of brown, grey, black, and white, offer a convincing sense of depth and foreboding. White heightening evokes a splash of foam that ribbons up in the air like lightning on the front right of the boat. The Mariner is shown with his back to us, faceless, bracing his weight with his right leg against the churning waves, as if to emphasize the struggle of humankind against the wilds of nature.",

The old woman at the center of the group could be Echo's protectorTerra, who sits above her and shields her from harm. Next to the old woman and dressed in a green gown, billowing red cape, and armor is a mysterious and yet to be identified woman. Her costume indicates that she is likely a goddess. Dossi painted this figure and then changed his mind and covered her up with a landscape. She was uncovered again during a restoration in the 1800s.Additional clues also tell scholars that the painting was cut down by about six inches on the left side at some point. The arm of anothercupidcan be seen at the painting's upper left edge, and a x-radiograph reveals the partially cut-off figure of a man under the lower part of the landscape.X-rayphotographs also display variouspentimenti, or alterations made by the artist.

There experts recognized it as an important, long-lost allegorical scene by the Ferrarese master Dosso Dossi.While the painting's precise meaning remains a mystery, Dosso's message seems to be that prosperity in life is transitory and dependent on luck. The nude woman represents Fortune, or Lady Luck. She holds acornucopia, flaunting the bounty that she could bring, but sits on a bubble because her favors are often fleeting. The billowing drapery is a reminder that she is changeable like the wind. Her single shoe symbolizes her ability to bring not only fortune but also misfortune.The man on the left personifies chance. He looks over at Fortune and holds up a stack of lottery tickets, which he is about to place inside a golden urn, a timely reference to the civic lotteries that had just become popular in Italy.

Initially artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes. However, because the white slip was rather fragile, by the mid- 400s B.C. artists limited the use of this technique to leykthoi used in funerary ritual.",

Scenes of the rivers Seine and Marne were among the artist's favorite subjects, the foliage and reflections of sky and scenery were prime inspiration for his pointillist works.The pointillist technique creates an overall image through tiny spots of color. It allows the viewer to almost feel the artist at work, as one can pick out the precise taps of the brush tip against the paper. When seen from afar, for example, this vista's gentle curves, especially those of the bank of trees at right, capture a lush depth and even volume. Up close, however, one can appreciate how this pointillist surface is built up of precise groupings of varying blues and greens, with highlights created by the tiny dots of yellow and of white paper showing through.The palette of this particular work has several striking elements. For example, the choice of orange for the water and clouds creates a sense of excitement in what might otherwise be a purely languorous, even pretty scene.The present sheet is closely related to a painting depicting the same view of the Marne, dated 1888 and currently in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris. This drawing is unlikely to have been a preparatory study, and is instead a more abstract adaptation after the painting, perhaps completed for a collector as a finished work of art in its own right.The work is signed by Dubois-Pillet in watercolor at the lower right.",

Dressed informally in a turban and bright red jacket, Ducreux, in the midst of a huge yawn, opens his mouth wide, contorting his face with the effort and stretching his right arm toward the viewer. Holding this exaggerated pose, his back sways and his stomach pushes forward; his entire body presses up close to the surface of the picture.Ducreux was interested in the study of physiognomy and frequently used his own features as a convenient means to observe various expressions. In fact, he executed dozens of similarly exaggerated self-portraits throughout his career. A contemporary critic admired this self-portrait for its warmth, color, and expression, but later critics complained about the repetition of the subject.",

Bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel's 984-foot (300-meter) tower of open-lattice wrought iron was selected in a competition to erect a memorial at the exposition. Twice as high as the dome of St. Peter's in Rome or the Great Pyramid of Giza, nothing like it had ever been built before. This view was made about four months short of the tower's completion. Louis-\u00c9mile Durandelle photographed the tower from a low vantage point to emphasize its monumentality. The massive building barely visible in the far distance is dwarfed under the tower's arches.Incidentally, the tower's innovative glass-cage elevators, engineered to ascend on a curve, were designed by the Otis Elevator Company of New York, the same company that designed the Getty Center's diagonally ascending tram.",

The man's sorrowful expression suggests that Albrecht D\u00fcrer intended this as a drawing of the good thief, who repented his crimes as he hung dying on the cross beside Christ.D\u00fcrer made this drawing in the studio; the forms became better defined as he went over the contours, outlining the body, chest, and abdomen with a stronger stroke. He then modeled the figure in three dimensions, using a combination of thin, parallel lines, cross-hatching, and short, rapid, repeated strokes. He probably drew the cross in last, after the figure was completed. The overall level of finish shows that D\u00fcrer considered this a preparatory study, a place to work out a basic pose and proportions before making awoodcut, engraving, or painting.",

Singling out a beetle as the focal point of a work of art was unprecedented in 1505, when most of D\u00fcrer's contemporaries believed that insects were the lowest of creatures. D\u00fcrer's keen interest in nature, however, was a typical manifestation of the Renaissance. This beetle, rendered with such care and respect, seems almost heroic as he looms above the page.D\u00fcrer probably made this drawing in the studio, based on quick sketches from nature and memory. The level of finish shows that he considered it an independent work of art, not a preparatory study. He used bodycolor to show volume, as in the hard, convex outer wings. Transparent washes represent light effects, such as the shadow cast by the body, which the legs raise off the ground.

Couples fondle one another in the more secluded spaces of a corner or balcony.Cornelis Dusart underscored his subjects' lewd behavior through suggestive details: rustic wooden furniture and earthenware jugs; food, pipes, and playing cards scattered about; patrons' ragged clothes and missing teeth. He used a sharpened piece of hard black chalk to draw on the smooth vellum and gray ink to define shadow areas; media that provide a light but fine rendering.The type of iconography depicted in this drawing was central to a genre of Dutch art in which everyday people are engaged in common activities. Drawings were often framed and hung, or simply pinned up, on the walls of middle-class homes.

Through such distortions, it may have been his goal to make the commonplace--people and things at a mini-mall--seem out of place.As Curator John Szarkowski of New York's Museum of Modern Art observed in his introduction toWilliam Eggleston's Guide,\"the design of most of the pictures seem to radiate from a central, circular core.\" Elevated on his stage and centered in the frame, the elephant is, absurdly, the star of this scene.

The janitor seems segregated from the rest of the world.Despite his proximity, this solitary black man seems unaware of the photographer. There is a sense of melancholy to his posture--perhaps what William Eggleston noticed most. Despite his patrician upbringing, Eggleston experienced the deep South before integration. He must have been keenly aware of the turmoil surrounding the civil rights movement, including numerous strikes and demonstrations that took place in Memphis. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis the year this photograph was made. Implied here is Eggleston's awareness of racial difference and the plight of the black worker.",

Eggleston focused on an older woman having coffee at the next table, who returns his gaze. A bright stripe on the wall behind her and a nearby neon clock sign also vie for the camera's attention. The sign's message, \"payroll checks cashed free,\" addresses the diner's working-class patrons--a friendly message in an alienating interior.Diners are ubiquitous places, fixtures of American road culture where inexpensive food can be had quickly. The diner is also an iconic subject of twentieth-century American art; it featured in Edward Hopper's paintings of the 1930s and Robert Frank's photographs inThe Americans,published in the 1950s. Eggleston's image extends their theme of lone city dwellers sitting forlornly in harshly lit eating establishments, looking as if they are trapped there.",

From a color negative, he made a positive print on paper containing three emulsion layers of silver salts sensitized respectively to red, green, and blue. During development, he added dye couplers that joined to the silver particles to form three color layers. The superimposition of the color layers produces a full-color image.",

On a road leading to the walled city of Jerusalem, horsemen pass by the execution hill, literally turning their backs on Christ.

Turning his eyes upward toward heaven, Christ looks away from the bones and skulls that lie at his feet, representative of his triumph over death. Light plays across his undulating form, illuminating his tortured body against the dark background. To heighten empathy between the viewer and Christ, the elongated but graceful figure appears alone. This private, devotional image was meant to encourage contemplation and spiritual reflection.Few paintings by El Greco can be entirely attributed to the artist himself, rather than his workshop. Scholars conclude that the bold handling of paint on this canvas, which includes undulating contours and vigorous dashes, confirms that El Greco painted it himself.

He might also have used this drawing as part of atriptych, flanked on each side byChristShown to the People and Christ Ascending to Heaven.With these early drawings, Ensor became increasingly preoccupied with portrayingJesusChrist. He began exploring the theme of Christ's entry, which evolved into his enormous painting,Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889.Ensor used graphite to outline all the elements of this complexcomposition, emphasizing special areas with Cont\u00e9 crayon. His lively linear technique imbued the whole scene with tumultuous energy. He used a similar technique to establish the main masses, drama, and focus of the scene on theverso, sketching a subject that he may have contemplated including in the series.",

In response to the Frenchpointilliststyle, Ensor usedpaletteknives, spatulas, and both ends of his brush to put down patches of colors with expressive freedom. He made several preparatory drawings for the painting, including one in the J. Paul Getty Museum's collection.Ensor's society is a mob, threatening to trample the viewer--a crude, ugly, chaotic, dehumanized sea of masks, frauds, clowns, andcaricatures. Public, historical, andallegoricalfigures along with the artist's family and friends made up the crowd. The haloed Christ at the center of the turbulence is in part a self-portrait: mostly ignored, a precarious, isolated visionary amidst the herdlike masses of modern society. Ensor's Christ functioned as a political spokesman for the poor and oppressed--a humble leader of the true religion, in opposition to the atheist social reformer Emile Littr\u00e9, shown in bishop's garb holding a drum major's baton leading on the eager, mindless crowd.After rejection byLes XX,the artists' association that Ensor had helped to found, the painting was not exhibited publicly until 1929. Ensor displayedChrist's Entryprominently in his home and studio throughout his life. With its aggressive,painterlystyle and merging of the public with the deeply personal,Christ's Entrywas a forerunner of twentieth-centuryExpressionism.",

Several features of the scene, such as the couch, the pillow, and especially the wreath the man wears, reveal that he is a participant at a symposion or drinking party. Many Greek vases, especially elaborate cups, were designed for use at such parties. Therefore, vase-painters frequently decorated these vessels with scenes of revelry and drinking. The circular area or tondo on the interior of a cup presented problems for Greek vase-painters. It was difficult to fit upright figures in this limited, curving space. Artists devised different solutions for this problem: some drew a line across the circle to create an artificial ground-line for their figures. On this vase, Epiktetos came up with a creative solution. He drew a line across the circle but made it the man's couch, rather than a ground-line. The edge of the man's mantle slipping down behind and below the line, creates the impression of depth and space. Epiktetos also used the circular frame of the tondo as part of the composition: it supports the man's pillow, and he props his foot on it.",

The precise identification of this figure is unclear: the youth may represent some mythological figure for whom sandals are meaningful, such as Theseus or Jason, or he may be a generic youth engaging in an everyday activity. The pose of this figure, standing but leaning over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C., yet this carver's skill in depicting a three-quarter view of the youth and in rendering the musculature in detail set this gem apart.Scarabs were pierced and generally worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the beetle side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When serving as a seal, the ring was removed, the scarab swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax placed on an object to identify and secure it.Greek gem carving changed dramatically in form, materials, and technique in the-mid 500s B.C. One of these changes was the introduction of the scarab, with its back carved like a beetle and its flat surface an intaglio. The scarab form ultimately derived from Egypt, where it had been used for seals and amulets for centuries. Certain features of Greek scarabs, however, such as the form of the beetle and the hatching around the intaglio motif, show the influence of Phoenician models, which the Greeks probably saw on Cyprus.",

After training, Greek athletes coated themselves in oil and used a strigil to scrape off the sweat, oil, and dirt. In part because it fills the oval space well, the pose of this figure, bending over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C. The difficult three-quarter view of the youth, the rendering of the musculature, and details such as the duck's head decorating the end of the strigil, however, display this artist's unique skills. The frequent depiction of athletes on gems of the late 500s B.C. reflects the interests of the men who owned them.A scaraboid is a simplified scarab. Rather than being carved as a beetle, the curved side of the stone is left plain. An intaglio design decorates the flat side. This scaraboid form gradually replaced the scarab in Greece in the 400s B.C.Scaraboid gems were pierced and worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the curved side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When needed as a seal, the ring was removed, the gem swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax to identify and secure property. The ring in which this scaraboid is set is modern. As small, personal items, gems were easy to carry; although this example was made in the Cyclades, it was found in Sicily.",

In most workshops, the master painters would paint the figures and a small strip of glaze around them. An apprentice would then cover the rest of the vase with glaze. On this example, the apprentice carefully dipped most of the cup into a bucket of glaze, except for the side with the figure. He then set out to fill in the area around the figure with brushed-on glaze. However, the glaze he used for this final step was too dilute, so it did not turn a solid black when the vase was fired.",

The buildings appear to bend toward one another, giving a claustrophobic sense of the closeness of urban high-rise living. A narrow strip of sky at the left is encroached upon on three sides, barely maintaining its blank white presence against the formidable towers.",

Although this was not one of the three Walker Evans photographs that illustrated the 1930 edition of Crane's work, this image could easily have been made with the above passage in mind. Evans positioned himself beneath the bridge, shooting up at the structure at a skewed angle that distortsperspective. The sweeping underside of the roadway dominates the frame, its imposing blackness an ominous focus beside the familiar arch of the upper bridge.",

        "description": "Walker Evans was attracted to all things uniquely American, and this structure's mixing of architectural styles without regard for historical accuracy was certainly an American phenomenon. This bizarre house probably appealed to Evans because of its distinctive combination of Gothic Revival and Greek Revival elements. Obviously Gothic Revival, two large, side-by-side arches span the porch, echoed by the small arched window on the upper facade, complete with pointed shutters. The Greek Revival fluted columns supporting the upper story's porch appear inconsistent, suggesting that this home may have been altered in an attempt to adopt a more fashionable style.In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Americans typically looked to catalogs and pattern books to determine the style in which they should build their homes. They often drew from various sources, choosing whichever elements they fancied. This eclecticism was especially appealing to Evans, whose quest for the typical often involved the many places Americans called home.",

Three rooflines dominate the composition and create a series of horizontal planes.

Two brick chimneys flanking the ends of the farmhouse and curtains hanging on the lower story's windows extend the sense of verticality.

In order to force details into their firmest relief, he could only work in brilliant sunlight, and the sun had to be on the correct side of the streets. Often many trips to the same house were necessary to avoid shadows cast by trees or other houses; only the spring and fall were favorable seasons. The forms were sharpened until so precise an image was achieved, that many of the houses seem to exist in an airless nostalgia for the pastSo wrote Lincoln Kirstein about Evans's images when Evans had his first solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1931 Evans traveled throughout New England photographing Victorian architecture. This study of the gingerbread, or decorative trimming, on a pump house in Kennebunkport, Maine, subtly juxtaposes clean, graphic shadows and highlights with the more fanciful ornamentation of the architecture. The lacy trimming of the overhang softens the stark, black rectangle of the doorway and the squares of the windows.",

The struggle to regain voting and citizenship rights began in this period, and African-Americans throughout the state established civic and voter leagues known as citizenship schools. Because illiteracy rates were high, ideas about voting and desegregation spread by word-of-mouth when people came together in small groups.It is difficult to know whether this topic spurred Evans to make the image. Although he was in the Deep South to photograph white sharecroppers forFortunemagazine, Evans had a habit of photographing whatever interested him. The architecture of the street and the assortment of goods on the sidewalk may have been what compelled him initially, but as a keen observer of people's habits, he was likely motivated by the individuals casually assembled in front of the store.",

Using moral terms to compare the commercial building of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the foreground with the domestic architecture of a house in the background, Evans found the latter to be lacking in authenticity.Although architecture may have been Evans's primary interest, his inclusion of the railroad in the left-hand corner of the image added a dynamic as well as a documentary aspect to the composition.

        "description": "From an elevated position, perhaps standing on a bridge or trestle, Walker Evans photographed railroad tracks receding around a bend in a small town. Several men huddle around a curb at the end of the station platform, while a solitary man carrying a package makes his way along the tracks beside a lingering snowbank. The blank gray sky, the heavy clothing on the figures, and the leafless trees in the background suggest the chill of winter. The image conveys sadness and a sense of desolation, despite the presence of people. Pushcarts sit abandoned between the tracks, and no trains stand at the station, and no passengers wait on the platform. The cars parked across from the station allude to the growing popularity of traveling by automobile rather than railroad.",

        "description": "Walker Evans captured this informal image of Floyd Burroughs and his daughter Lucille at they sat on their porch in Hale County, Alabama. The man's tattered clothing and their lack of shoes demonstrate the family's economic struggle at the height of the Depression. During a month-long expedition, Evans and the writer James Agee documented the lives of three families of white Southern sharecroppers for an article inFortunemagazine. Evans photographed the interiors and exteriors of the families' homes, barns, and churches and made many portraits. Their work never appeared inFortune, but the resulting book,Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,published in 1941, became a landmark of social journalism.",

        "description": "We live in a part of the country that some call The Bible Belt. Most folks around here go to church regular. Many of my friends have to go on Sunday and again on Wednesday Night.These words from a thirteen-year-old boy aptly describe the area where Walker Evans photographed this church interior. Worship was and is central to the lives of many Southerners. Evans spent a month in the South with the writer James Agee, interviewing local residents and making images of their way of life for aFortunemagazine story on sharecroppers.Rather than photographing the church full of worshippers, Evans showed it empty to emphasize its bare-bones simplicity. The ornate imported organ contrasts with the homemade plank pews and unadorned window. A small sign on the wall sets out six goals for the \"100 percent pupil\"--presumably a bible student--awarding ten points for offerings, something few actually could have made at this time. An adjacent blackboard records attendance at class, including several picturesque misspellings.",

Documentary, very real, very complex. All these people had posed in front of the local studio camera, and I bring my camera, and they all pose again together for me. That's a fabulous fact.Walker Evans was in the South a number of times during the 1930s. While in Savannah, he photographed this photo-studio shop front. Storefronts remained a consistent theme in Evans's work, but this image spoke to him in a particularly poignant way. Young women, servicemen, professionals, couples, children, sisters, and a father and his daughter fill the window, all tightly arranged. These were the subjects Evans sought: not celebrities in highly decorated studios but everyday people.",

Construction began in 1900, the public boarded in 1904, and by the 1930s there were 650 miles of subterranean rapid transit in operation. The cost of a ride was five cents; for the purposes of Walker Evans's continuing quest to obtain anonymous portraits, this was the place \"where the people of the city range themselves at all hours under the most constant conditions.\"In order to remain inconspicuous, Evans used a hidden camera: a small, fast Contax that he painted flat black, strapped to his chest, and operated with a long wire strung down his right sleeve. He and the writer James Agee may have planned to collaborate on a volume of subway portraits, but Evans's concern about adverse reactions from some of his unsuspecting sitters caused him to defer this idea until 1966. This maquette of sixteen prints was assembled, but never used, for that endeavor, which he finally published with Agee's Introduction as the bookMany Are Called.",

The community, whose population was then a mere 8,000, also built laundries and social halls for the seasonal visitor. Walker Evans made this photograph while on a six-week assignment in Florida. He was hired to illustrate the 1942 publicationThe Mangrove Coast: The Story of the West Coast of Florida,a comprehensive book detailing the geology of the region and the legends of its explorers. Most of the pictures depict the habits of what Evans called \"winter resorters,\" retirees who seasonally descended upon the southern vacationland.Evans was fascinated by people's homes, often photographing their interiors and exteriors. Tenements in the Deep South, Gothic Revival cottages in the north, and even mass-produced trailers like this--all were of deep interest to him.",

Although Evans was not interested in making social statements, he was keenly aware of the disparity between the lives of those in the parade and those who watched from the sidelines.Walker Evans made this image in Bridgeport, Connecticut, many years before the civil rights movement, while on assignment withFortunemagazine.

Photographing pliers, chisels, trowels, scissors, and bevels was a fitting assignment for Evans, who found items of everyday use intriguing.

In this view of a recently constructed thirty-four-story building at 750 Third Avenue, Evans made clear that a new architectural style had invaded his city and the effect on the residents was not good. A Chaplinesque figure leaving the safety of the curb seems thrown off-balance by his surroundings, his disorientation much like that of French comedian Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot trying to make his way around 1960s Paris.",

Walking the street with his camera, Walker Evans put together a photographic series, apparently planned for publication inFortune, on Third Avenue in transition. The subject matter is vintage Evans: secondhand shop displays, window shoppers, sparse trees, condemned buildings, and new construction. He always preferred the decrepit to the new, the traditional to the modern, the dated manner of antique curios to current design.",

In opposition to the current men's fashion photography, Evans called his work \"documentary fashion photography.\"",

He was introduced to the instantaneous Polaroid SX-70 camera and color film in 1972 and used it for two years, primarily making portraits of colleagues, friends, and students. Eventually he made more than 2,400 Polaroid images.In this photograph, Evans's familiar love of signs and words is evident in the cryptic message \"DEAD END\" that has been spray-painted on a metal sign. It is uncanny as well as ironic, given that the Polaroid camera marked a new and fruitful path in Evans's career.",

More sedately, the older ladies inside the carriage wear bonnets since the top has been lowered. Because the horses fidgeted during the exposure, their heads are blurred, preventing the ensemble of figures, carriage, and horses from becoming a completely static silhouette against the facade of the house.The dramatic drop from the grassy foreground into blackness makes the entire scene appear as though it occurred on some kind of elaborate stage set. Eynard was well acquainted with stage design. Inside this house was a private theater, and on another occasion he brought the theater's painted sets outside to be photographed.",

His father, the Expressionist painter Lyonel Feininger, was a teacher there. The style promoted by the Bauhaus--spare, geometric, and functional design--was one of the most influential in the 1920s and 1930s. A self-taught photographer, Feininger carried his nine-by-twelve-inch box camera wherever he went and recorded everyday life at the school. The framing of his photographs reflects the influence of Modernism and vividly transmits the creativity, spontaneity, and enthusiasm of life at the Bauhaus.",

Another sixteenth-century building, the Cathedral of the Archangel, neighbors the bell tower.In September 1852, Fenton-who had only taken up photography a few months earlier-traveled to Russia with an acquaintance who was constructing a bridge for Czar Nicholas I. Perhaps recognizing that he was one of the first photographers to train his camera on Russia, Fenton made views of Moscow and St. Petersburg, capturing the distinct architectural character of each city.

At an earlier time, historical and scientific specimens were recorded in the form of drawings or engravings. But the new medium of photography offered greater accuracy and efficiency, and the museum hired Roger Fenton.During Fenton's seven-and-a-half years photographing for the museum, this extinct creature's skeleton was probably his most unusual subject. Photography reveals the skeleton's scaffold support of thin wires, its many vertebrae, and its strange proportions-from a tiny head and long neck, to wide hips and giant talons.Fenton set up a studio within the museum and became very innovative at arranging and lighting his subjects. He developed methods that are still used by commercial photographers today. Against an interior brick wall, he hung white sheets to form a backdrop so that he could more clearly emphasize the subject's physical structure. Skylight windows probably lit this particular specimen, but Fenton also relocated art objects onto the museum's rooftop to record them in direct sunlight for greater clarity.",

In this photograph his sleeve is conspicuously pinned up in a kind of half-mast salute.Raglan sits in a doorway and looks away from the camera, his careworn body positioned at the boundary between light and shadow. Although the positioning is practical in terms of the light source, it is also metaphorical, placing Raglan on the cusp between a brilliant career and the twilight of life. The bright-white plumage of his hat lies across his lap like a dying bird. The bird is perhaps symbolic; Raglan was gravely ill with dysentery when the photograph was made and died within the month.",

Across a desolate and featureless landscape, not a single figure can be found. The landscape is inhabited only by cannonballs--so plentiful that they first appear to be rocks--that stand in for the human casualties on the battlefield. The sense of emptiness and unease is heightened by the visual uncertainty created by the changing scale of the road and the sloping sides of the ravine.Borrowing from the Twenty-thirdPsalmof theBible, the Valley of Death was named by British soldiers who came under constant shelling there. Fenton traveled to the dangerous ravine twice, and on his second visit he made two exposures. Fenton wrote that he had intended to move in closer at the site. But danger forced him to retreat back up the road, where he created this image.On a commissioned assignment, Fenton traveled in 1853 to the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea, where England, France, and Turkey were fighting a war against Russia. To avoid offendingVictoriansensibilities, Fenton refrained from photographing the dead and wounded. His more than three hundred images of encampments, battle sites, and portraits of all miltary ranks, became the first extensive photo-documentation of any war. When exhibited in England, Fenton's photographs of the Crimean War established his reputation.",

Even after marriage, usually an arranged pairing with an extremely sheltered fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girl, a man probably spent little to no time with his wife.

The Virgin and Child sit in three-quarter profile in a room defined only by its receding tile floor and deep red curtains. The Virgin's long golden hair, fine facial features, and narrow shoulders give her a youthful and delicate appearance, drawing on the contemporary ideal of female beauty.

These signs of his new noble status are clearly significant to Varie, who rose from the merchant class through his work as an official in the French royal treasury.Although the artist Jean Fouquet presented Simon and the Virgin in separate miniatures, he linked the interior spaces of the two illuminations. The floor tiles on both pages share the same vanishing point, so that the lines of recession suggested by the floor tiles converge at a point between the two miniatures.

Fra Bartolommeo captured the trunk's gnarled form using small flecks of black chalk, later carefully reworking the branch at the right in brush and brown ink. He constructed two smaller, bushier trees at the left with broad parallel strokes of chalk that simulate the lacy, atmospheric effect of light passing through leaves.Fra Bartolommeo was clearly fascinated by the contorted and variegated forms of tree trunks and the patterns and texture of leaves. He produced many tree studies, of which this is the largest one to have survived.

The dynamic, plunging perspective of walls and trees and the intense light infuse the massive architecture with life.Fragonard masterfully used both chalk and paper to create the overall effect and the varied small passages. Overall, he worked the red chalk lightly yet broadly, allowing the white of the paper to come through even in areas of deepest shading. His controlled exposure of the paper's whiteness, the constant shift of direction and character in his shading strokes, and his inventive calligraphy describe sunlight, shadow, and texture in diverse ways.",

The woman's pose, taken from representations of the penitent saint Mary Magdalene, the reformed New Testament courtesan traditionally depicted with long, flowing hair, further emphasizes the drawing's light, satirical tone.Fragonard's light, fluent washes also work to convey a sense of abandonment, evident especially in the wildly tossed-about bedclothes. These fluid passages contrast with the arresting precision of the woman's eye, nostril, and mouth, captured in small marks made with the point of the brush.In the later 1760s, Fragonard created a number of drawings devoted to erotic themes.

Putti frolic in the fountain's waters and billowing spray, and one of them offers a cup of the magical liquid for the young lovers to drink. The story of the Garden of Love, an allegory of the nature and progress of love that has its origins in the poetry of classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, centers on this Fountain of Love. The fountain brings forth the water in which Cupid dips his arrows or from which lovers drink and fall in love. In nearly every period, artists have painted this romantic motif. During the 1700s, artists came to treat the Fountain of Love almost as a genre subject, with lovers in contemporary dress flirting in a garden around a decorative fountain. With this version, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard returned the allegory to its classical origins and imbued it with the thrilling rush of those first beguiling moments of love. The quintessential Rococo artist, Fragonard responded to the Neoclassical movement in an extremely inventive manner, adding a soft, steamy atmosphere to his cameo-like figures.",

A minimally defined face reveals only an impassive expression--this is a human figure outside of time or place.Elisabeth Frink traced her interest in sculpting the male figure back to World War II. As a child, her family lived near an airfield that was visited frequently by Polish airmen who struck her as foreign and mysterious. According to the artist, many of her representations of men were influenced by these early memories and consequently she treated the male body as withheld, mysterious, and threatening.

With its long neck extended, head turned to one side, its ears pointed forward, and confident stride, the animal appears alert to its surroundings. But the marked divots, incisions and striations covering the form's surface remind the viewer that this impressive horse is cast in heavy bronze.Elisabeth Frink's affection for horses stemmed from her country childhood in Sussex, England. Her father was a skilled horseman and an amateur jockey, which added to an enthusiasm that continued throughout her life. But it was only when she moved to France in the late 1960s that Frink began creating sculptures of horses. She would continue to explore this subject for many years often representing a horse and male rider.This sculpture was made from a plaster cast created in 1980. The form was originally commissioned for a Sussex racecourse. Frink claimed that her sculptures of horses were about \"the ancient spirit of the horse and its evolution in relation to man.\"",

A large cup sits adjacent to her, probably for collecting charity. No parent or older sibling appears to be nearby to keep an eye on this vulnerable child who has been placed in a frightening and dangerous position. H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda's photograph depicts the struggle of one of Mexico's poorest social classes through the eyes of a seemingly abandoned young girl.To make this portrait, Garc\u00eda employed a straightforward photographic approach, framing the picture from inside a passing car. Thisperspectiveis in keeping with his objective of capturing the plight of the urban poor with honesty and without embellishment.",

Lee was forced to retreat to Virginia. Just two weeks after the victory, President and Commander-in-Chief Abraham Lincoln conferred with General McClernand and Allan Pinkerton, Chief of the nascent Secret Service, who had organized espionage missions behind Confederate lines.Lincoln stands tall, front and center in his stovepipe hat, his erect and commanding posture emphasized by the tent pole that seems to be an extension of his spine. The other men stand slightly apart in deference to their leader, in postures of allegiance with their hands covering their hearts. The reclining figure of the man at left and the shirt hanging from the tree are a reminder that, although this is a formally posed picture, Lincoln's presence did not halt the camp's activity, and no attempts were made to isolate him from the ordinary circumstances surrounding the continuing military conflict.",

E.] Lee's broken army. Through the shadowy vapors, it was, indeed, a \"harvest of death\" that was presented; hundreds and thousands of torn Union and rebel soldiers--although many of the former were already interred--strewed the now quiet fighting ground, soaked by the rain, which for two days had drenched the country with its fitful showers.This paragraph opens the text that Alexander Gardner wrote to accompany this photograph inGardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.Both text and image eloquently capture the war's toll of death and destruction, especially apparent after the Battle of Gettysburg, which took place from July 1 to July 3, 1863. Although Gardner's caption identifies the men in the photograph as \"rebels represented...without shoes,\" they are probably Union dead. During the Civil War, shoes were routinely removed from corpses because supplies were scarce and surviving troops needed them.",

General Reynolds was killed during the battle and had already been removed from the field.

The man seated in the center, next to the stretcher laden with human parts, looks directly at the camera, revealing no emotion that can be reconciled with his grisly cargo.Already reduced to nothing more than a pile of bones, these bodies lay unburied for ten months until the war's end, while the blistering heat and humidity of the Virginia summer hastened their decomposition. Local residents usually came forth to give a proper burial to the enemy troops that fell near their homes, but the scale of the casualties here--nearly sixty thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded in this area--precluded this courtesy.",

The lack of a proper station platform, however, suggests that some passengers remained aboard the train and that this was a momentary stop to produce a contrived image. The conspicuous absence of women in the image is also a reminder that pioneering was primarily done by men: in 1850 only 7,000 of California's 94,000 residents were women.Alexander Gardner made this photograph two years before the completion of the transcontinental railroad, when the railroad companies were investing heavily in advertising. Many companies hired photographers to produce large images such as this one along their routes for documentary and promotional purposes. To create a sense of movement echoing the exciting advance of the train across the landscape, Gardner positioned his camera directly on top of the rails, with the Union Pacific train boldly emerging from the left and receding across thepicture plane.",

There's a little ponding of brine; it hasn't formed white crystals yet. Those will dry up before the year is out and turn white crystalline salt in place of that.--William GarnettMany of William Garnett's later photographs, like this one of Owens Lake, were shot in color. The orange-red diagonal shape resembles a flame with whitish edges, with surrounding hues ranging from cream to black. These colors indicate the presence of salt-eating microbacteria, representing a stage in the lake's annual cycle of flooding and drying out. Garnett made at least 100 images of Owens Lake during his career as an aerial photographer. Many of his commercial clients included geological and chemical industries, and the lake--located in the Mojave Desert--was along one of his frequent flight paths.Subjects like Owens Lake demonstrate Garnett's lifelong concern for the conservation of natural resources. The Owens Valley Aqueduct, built between 1908 and 1913, siphoned off the once-fertile valley's water for use by a growing Los Angeles population, creating an ecological disaster.",

But he portrayed more than plants: his diminutive humans express a contemplative spirituality in which humanity is both immersed in and one with nature.

Real events, from Tahitian King Pomare V's death soon after Gauguin's arrival, to the artist having witnessed a public execution by guillotine several years earlier, likely influenced its dark subject matter. Gauguin added the Tahitian words \"Arii\" and \"Matamoe\" in the canvas' upper left. The first means \"noble;\" the second, \"sleeping eyes,\" a phrase that implies \"death.\"The notion of a human head ritually displayed in an ornate interior suggests the formality of a ruler lying in state, supported by the presence of sorrowful figures in the background. However, this scene doesn't correspond to actual accounts of Pomare V's funeral because the body wasn't decapitated. Gauguin was just as apt to fantasize about life in Polynesia as he was to document it. Bright reds, yellows, and pinks are juxtaposed with muted browns and purples to evoke a tropical sensibility. The rough, burlap-like canvas also hints at an exotic \"primitivism.\" In his collage-illustrated bookNoa Noa--which he began after his first trip to Tahiti--he included a copy of this painting and a comment that he thought of Pomare's death as a metaphor for the loss of native culture due to European colonization.Symbolist artists, including Gauguin, had a predilection for images of decapitated heads and any associated figures, such as Orpheus and John the Baptist. But in a more general sense, Gauguin also freely mixed Eastern and Western imagery. His obsession with the theme of death, which appears throughout his Tahitian paintings, is less a reference to spiritual beliefs or to what he saw around him than perhaps more significantly, how he viewed himself. Gauguin thought of himself as a martyr victimized by modern society, which compelled him to escape to a \"primitive\" culture.",

He made the sculpture while living in Tahiti, where he studied the native culture and, to a great extent, identified with the local people.

The hypnotic eyes and the smooth, warm surface of the finely finished wood are captivating. To Western viewers, the sinister horns suggest evil; however, in Tahiti, this attribute resembles a style of hair--bunched in knots at either side of the head--worn by young men as an expression of power.This intriguing and complex sculpture was probably displayed in Gauguin's home in Tahiti, but it was lost sometime in the 1890s.

I have at this moment a series of experimental drawings that I'm fairly pleased with. I'm sending you a small specimen; it's like an impression and yet it isn't. Thick ink replaces pencil, that's all...--Paul GauguinNear the end of his life in isolated French Polynesia, Gauguin invented his own technique to produce this unique, double-sided image. Both sides depict a young Tahitian woman as Eve in the Garden of Eden, surrounded by the Devil as a snake, a dark figure on horseback, and a fallen Adam. One side of the drawing consists of fine blue and black lines. Those markings are not only flipped or mirrored on the other side, but appear thicker and darker amid murky patches of black and ocher ink. This more colorful and detailed side was probably what Gauguin intended viewers to see.On its surface, Gauguin's experimental drawing looks primitive and casually made. However, its rough appearance belies a very sophisticated work, with nuanced mark-making and carefully aligned applications of color. The closest analogy to Gauguin's process might be the act of writing or drawing on carbon paper, which transfers marks to underlying pages.Gauguin coated a piece of paper with printer's ink. He placed another sheet of paper--what was to become this drawing--on top of it and drew the initial composition with black pencil. Then he blocked-in shading with ocher ink. Third, he strengthened the outlines with blue crayon. The pressure applied by the drawing instruments transferred ink to the underside of the sketched paper. For these successive \"printings,\" Gauguin had to change out the original sheet of inked paper and allow the drawing to dry, at least partially, between passes of ink. Last, he took a brush dipped in solvent and blended some areas of the drawing, most notably behind the figure of Eve.Gauguin's long-term obsession with the biblical story of \"the fall of man\" enabled him to explore dual themes such as good and evil in a single work. As with many of his images, the way that Gauguin used symbols--their context and juxtaposition--complicate interpretation. For example, although Eve gazes directly at the viewer, it is difficult to tell whether her expression is confident or baleful. Her awkward gestures, one hand holding a cloth to her genitals and the other against her cheek, perhaps indicate shameful awareness of her sinful actions.This particular Eve and the head of a hooded figure behind her originate from a drawing Gauguin made at least eight years earlier. He repeatedly incorporated these exact motifs into subsequent paintings and woodcuts. In this case also, the horse behind Eve may be inspired by a frieze design from the Parthenon, which Gauguin had in his collection of source materials brought from Europe. The hooded rider incorporates some of Gauguin's own features, and may also symbolize Death.",

With his right arm wrapped limply around Belisarius's neck and his eyes closed, the youth balances precariously between life and death. Belisarius's eyes are also closed, but guided by his stick he moves forward with determination and purpose. He rises heroically against the spectacular sunset, a monumental figure creating a powerful outline against the sky. But the flaring sunset also signals a chill night and the uncertainty of the path ahead.Belisarius was a popular Byzantine general of the Roman Empire whose promising career was sabotaged by the jealous Emperor Justinian I. In 1767, a novel by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Marmontel revived interest in Belisarius. In Marmontel's novel, the emperor has the heroic general blinded, reducing Belisarius to begging. He is eventually rediscovered and aided by former officers and his family. This dramatic tale of patriotism, injustice, and redemption was widely embraced in revolutionary and post-revolutionary France and was a popular subject for artists--including Jacques-Louis David (Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard's teacher), Jean-Antoine Houdon, and Jean-Baptiste Stouf (whose sculptureBelisariusis also in the Museum's collection).For this painting, G\u00e9rard both drew and departed from Marmontel's retelling of Belisarius's life. The general's young companion is present in Marmontel's novel. But to stress the bravery and pathos of the subject, G\u00e9rard introduced the incapacitating snakebite. While Belisarius was typically depicted in the act of begging, G\u00e9rard shows him standing and erect, his muscular form in sharp contrast to his guide's weakening body. The prominent helmet hanging from Belisarius's belt emphasizes the general's heroic past and underscores the injustice of his fall from favor.",

This study marks the moment just before the race begins, when the terrified riderless horses begin their run down the Corso in Rome.A groom tries to contain a rearing horse in the center, while other men all around push and pull the wild animals, goading them into a frenzied stampede. G\u00e9ricault used virtually monochromatic colors applied in thick swirls to animate and suggest extreme physical strength. The dramatic use of light and shadow adds energy to the relieflike scene. G\u00e9ricault mythologized the event: the muscular nude in the center recalls athletes of ancient Greece, and the thrusting horses bring to mind the Parthenonfriezedesigned by Phidias. G\u00e9ricault intended to use this study for a grand painting to submit to theSalon, but he had to abandon that plan when he was called back to France on short notice.",

The dramatic story of an Arab Christian living as an infidel within his Muslim homeland tapped the vogue for Orientalism, which stemmed in part from Napoleon's recent campaigns in Egypt and Syria. G\u00e9ricault's choice of subject matter was also affected by his passion for horses, which he often represented with great sensitivity.On a visit to England in 1820, G\u00e9ricault learned the British style of watercolor painting, which emphasized translucentwashesthat allowed the white of the paper to shine through. After faintly sketching thegiaouron theversoof this sheet, he used the translucency of the watercolor to render the Arabian stallion's shining coat and the dramatically lit sky and ground in this finished drawing. The lithograph made after the drawing less effectively expresses the Romantic sense of drama.",

Lying on its side, the small rabbit is flanked by the game birds: an ortolan and a snipe with a long beak. A cauliflower with raggedly trimmed stalk and leaves rises above the animals. The still life also includes an onion, a turnip, a gherkin, a truffle, and a morel mushroom. Leafy plants peek out at the edges of a rocky ground evoking the earthen floor of a wood or glade.The termMachine d'Argent(literally, \"silver machine\") was first assigned to this sculpture by Jean-Baptiste Oudry, who acted as intermediary between Fran\u00e7ois-Thomas Germain and thepatron, Christian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg. In the 1700s, the wordmachinesignified an artistic innovation as well as a mechanicaldevice. Germain was specifically commissioned to create a decorative centerpiece to complement a series of paintings owned by the Duke that depicted exotic animals and scenes of the hunt. The sculpted game birds and rabbit represent trophies of the hunt. Combined with the root vegetables and mushrooms, the animals also alluded to the ingredients of a rich stew.Using a secret casting technique,Machine d'Argenttook seven months to create. Germain cast some of the still life elements from molds of dead animals or vegetables. These individual elements were then assembled together on the base. The rich variety of detail showcased Germain's ability to transform silver into the diverse textures of nature: from the soft fur of the rabbit and downy feathers of the ortolan to the multi-beaded head of cauliflower and the smooth, waxy skin of the onion bulb.",

Focusing on the intricate task of lighting the fuse of his musket, the soldier wears a large plumed hat, billowing striped pantaloons, and high boots, with powder charges strung across his breast. De Gheyn used a simple but imposing pose to create interest, with long, diagonal lines created by the soldier's musket, his sword, and the intersecting angle of his musket rest.Conceived as a military handbook for the infantry,Exercise of Armscontained one hundred and seventeen designs illustrating the use of the smallshot, the musket, and the pike.

Paying close attention to the fall of light, de Gheyn evoked the textures of the youth's clothing--especially the turban--with beautiful, varied penwork that demonstrates the creases and gathers. He built up the other heads using rather somewhat more regular cross-hatching.De Gheyn first sketched the three foreground figures of the young boy and two men, then later added the angel and the female head. He seems to have been one of the first artists to mingle figures drawn from nature with those from his imagination.

Jacques de Gheyn II meticulously recorded the amphibian's long hind legs and loose skin. But on closer inspection the frog was clearly imbued with human characteristics. Its webbed feet were transformed into claw-like hands and the exaggerated hump on its back evokes a grotesque old man. With its raised head and prominent eye, the frog even appears to hold an impassive, almost haughty expression. De Gheyn pushed the boundaries of the natural world further: the frog sits atop a pile of coins and with its left \"hand\" grasps a sphere about the same size as its twisted trunk.Somewhere between a realistic rendering of nature and an imaginative fantasy, the frog is an allegory of avarice. The creature does not merely rest on the coins but reaches greedily and uncouthly between its legs to grasp at them. The large sphere may symbolize the earth and the frog all the world's greed. Appropriate to the sin of avarice, the humanized frog is itself a monstrous perversion of the natural world.Fascinated by nature, De Gheyn created a large number of allegorical and anatomical drawings of amphibians, mice and rats, horses and donkeys, and insects. This small study was probably part of a much larger sheet covered with other fantastical images. Collectors considered such sheets marvels of virtuosity and imaginative power.",

The three nude figures join together with drapery in a spiral from which Proserpine gracefully extends her arms, reaching out and up in resistance. In contrast to the figures' animated gestures, their faces are relatively expressionless. Fran\u00e7ois Girardon's large bronze of Pluto Abducting Proserpine represents the violent abduction of Zeus and Demeter's young daughter by the god of the underworld. This event explained the change of the seasons in Greek mythology: in response to Demeter's grief at the loss of her daughter, Zeus and Pluto agreed that Proserpine, who represented Spring, would spend six months of the year above ground with her mother and the remaining six underground with Pluto, thus causing winter.Louis XIV commissioned four monumental marble abduction groups to decorate the corners of Charles LeBrun's never-completed garden at Versailles, the Parterre d'Eau. This bronze is a version of Girardon's preparatory model for one of these statues. Each group of three figures symbolized one of the four elements: earth, air, wind, and fire. Pluto's association with hell made him an apt symbol of fire.",

To relieve the monotony of the strict symmetry, the artist varied details such as the colors of the apostles' robes, the men's gestures, and the arrangement of books around the candles.

Both are emblems of the chivalric Order of Santiago, Saint James the Greater.As an artist to several courts, Jan Gossaert traveled widely throughout Europe and became one of the first painters to disseminate the Italian Renaissance style in the Netherlands.

She is pretty, not vacuous, but her questioning gaze and awkward cradling of the jug betray her uncertainty. Goya's caption, the drawing's title, tells the whole story: He admonishes her for playing at being a peasant, a practice then fashionable among the upper classes. Even as he rebuked this young woman, he flattered her, setting her alone and off-center on the sheet with a few pen strokes and a bit of wash to give her grounding. At least seventy years old when he made this drawing, Goya remained fluid and spontaneous in his technique, quickly capturing the swaying of her skirt and the little crinkles in her sleeve.",

Finally, the goddess caused the statue to come to life. As Pygmalion's wife, she came to be called Galatea.In a possible self-portrait, Goya depicted Pygmalion with his legs spread wide, readying himself to take a mighty swing at the chisel, which is aimed at Galatea's crotch. Leaning slightly forward, she looks out with a fearful expression. Goya's animated interpretation of the well-known myth is highly original and even mocking.

He enhanced the old man's sense of isolation by placing him low on the page, allowing the blank background to suggest his loneliness. Blank paper evokes his bald head, and the india ink provided clean black strokes and exceptionally fine gray washes for the high dramatic contrasts Goya valued.

Closely basing the setting and arrangement of figures on Peter Paul Rubens's version, Greuze probably made this oil sketch as the final stage of preparation for an unexecuted, large-scale painting. Contemporaries admired the rapid execution, vibrant colors, and lively paint handling in Greuze's oil sketches. The criticDenis Diderotlavishly praised his combination ofgenreandhistory paintingand his public, moralizing purpose.",

Here he only quickly indicated the woman's cap and hood, concentrating his attention on the emotional and expressive qualities of her haggard face with its furrowed brow, penetrating eyes, and parted lips.Greuze made this drawing as a preparatory study for the figure of a woman kneeling at her husband's bedside in one of his best-known paintings,La Dame de Charit\u00e9, completed in 1775 at the height of his career. Greuze's narrative paintings were highly theatrical, with facial expression and gesture conveying the story. As seen here, Greuze usually heightened the drama by depicting his figures at the peak of emotion.",

Jean-Baptiste Greuze portrayed the mother and daughter in fine clothing to emphasize the disparity between their lives and that of the impoverished couple, whose only valuable possession, a sword, is prominently displayed behind them. Greuze was famous for moralizing images like this one, which were meant to illustrate the importance of good deeds and childhood instruction in a domestic setting. InThe Charitable Woman,a complex scene that explores a wide range of human expression, he used spontaneous applications of wash to intensify the sense of drama.Greuze producedThe Charitable Womanas a compositional study for a painting of the same name,now in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon. Prior to making this drawing, he made numerous studies of individual figures, such as theStudy of the Head of an Old Woman,who is one of the principal characters in this scene. These carefully rendered drawings provide evidence of Greuze's working methods and testify to his careful preparation.",

Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, grasps his left hand urging him toward virtuous restraint. The god of wine, Bacchus, pours wine onto the young man to arouse his desires. Cupid, the tiny child-god of love, directs the youth's face toward his mother Venus who presses her right breast, emblematic of sybaritic pleasures.The entire surface of the vessel is carved and showcases the technical virtuosity of its maker, Balthasar Griessmann. This ivory specialist skillfully moved between different degrees of relief: from figures fully sculpted in three-dimensions to extremely shallow passages. Floral Bacchic motifs cover the lid, base, and stem of the vessel. Putti bearing fruit-laden garlands cavort around the lid, which is surmounted at the pinnacle with a single putto brandishing a cup in one hand and a bunch of grapes in the other. At the base lie recumbent drunken putti and satyrs.Griessmann faithfully derived the goblet's composition from a work by Otto van Veen,Allegory of the Temptations of Youth, known to the carver from a print by Antwerp artist Pieter Perret. Griessmann cunningly puts the allegory in the hands of the imbiber, who--like the youth--should consider the balance of indulgence with moderation. The virtuosity of the piece is such that it was most likely displayed at courtly banquets--a showpiece, to be viewed and admired, rather than utilized.",

Protecting herself from the sun, she holds a small blue parasol and wears a bonnet. Touches of white--her gloves, sleeves, and flowing scarf--offset her blue and purple ensemble. Between her billowy sleeves and her gloves, the woman displays golden jewelry. She demurely reaches down with her left hand to hold up her voluminous dress. This mass of material contrasts sharply with her small head and single foot peaking out from below.The woman's immense dress would have been supported by an elaborate structure of crinolines or stiffened petticoats. Constantin Guys produced this drawing at the height of fashion for crinolines and full skirts. To suggest many layers of thin fabric, Guys built up layer upon layer of wash and repeating triangles drawn in ink. Guys' attention to contemporary fashion and make-up made him Charles Baudelaire's quintessential painter of modern life. But Baudelaire championed \"Monsieur G\" not merely for conveying appearances and artifice. For Baudelaire, Guys' watercolors and drawings not only captured his subjects in the present moment, but also imbued them with a look of timelessness, elevating them to the status of historical figures.",

One can't help but notice the crisp details that surround her, like the signage of at least three banks.This photograph is part of Anthony Hernandez's series,Public Transit Areas(1979-80), which focused on people waiting at bus stops in Los Angeles. The invasive, sensory elements of the city vie for attention with vulnerable looking individuals immersed in their own private worlds. Hernandez used relatively large photographic equipment--a five-by-seven-inch camera mounted on a tripod--to achieve sharp focus throughout his images. A consistent, formulaic approach tocompositionalso heightens the visual tension. By centering his human subjects in the frame, the street's one-pointperspectiveas it recedes into the distance is emphasized.Backgrounddetails compete for attention because their specifics change from image to image, even as the placement of basic elements remains fixed.",

        "description": "On this preserved section of recomposed fragments of a large drinking cup-or skyphos--a man balances himself on his right foot as he lifts his left leg and drinks from a large white cup. Individual figures in amusing poses were often used to decorate red-figured drinking cups destined for use in the symposion. But rather than leaving the background in red clay according to the red-figure tradition, the red figure on thisskyphoshas been applied to the surface of the vase with thick, bright red paint atop a black gloss ground. The details of the youth's anatomy have been incised into the red paint with such precision that only the black gloss is penetrated--the red clay beneath it remains covered. His hair is bound by a fillet painted in the purplish added red that is traditional; likewise red is also the color used for the double groundline on which he balances. His cup, which he grasps by the stem of the foot, was painted in added white on top of the black gloss. This convention typically works better in black-, rather than red-figure, technique. An alternating red and black tongue ornament encircles the complete vase. Notably, the painter seems to have accidentally spattered black gloss on portions of the borders, smearing one of the tongues directly beneath the drinker's right foot. There, he left his fingerprint.This cup offers an example of Six's Technique, named after Dutch scholar Jan Six, who first studied it. It features white, red, and orange designs painted atop of a black-gloss ground, and often includes delicately incised silhouette. The technique was invented around the same time as thered-figure technique, in approximately 525 B.C.  Both feature a light-on-dark appearance that contrasts with the dark-on-light effect of the olderblack-figure technique.",

He was at first incredulous, but went to Mr.[Robert]Adamson, and arranged with him preliminaries for getting all the necessary portraits.Seeing the opportunity for photography to assist in the process of making preliminary studies for painting, Brewster introduced Hill to Adamson, who had recently opened a photographic studio in Edinburgh.

It was in Edinburgh where the first earnest, professional practice of the art began, and thecalotypesof Messrs. Hill and Adamson remain to this day the most picturesque specimens of the new discovery.So wrote Elizabeth Rigby of the photographers in 1857. Rigby became a popular sitter for David Hill and Robert Adamson, appearing in more than twenty of their calotypes. In this image she seems lost in thought. Although leaning forward, she does not engage the viewer. The commonmotifof books alludes to her intellectual abilities.Rigby lived in Edinburgh during the 1840s, where she was welcomed into distinguished literary and social circles. Critical of the disruption within the Church of Scotland, she described how she left one of its assemblies \"thoroughly disgusted\" over the \"horrible display of vulgarities.\" Upon marrying Sir Charles Eastlake in 1849, she assumed the title Lady Eastlake but retained her connection to photography since he became the first president of theRoyal Photographic Societyin London in 1853.",

Of the eleven men pictured here, it is likely that not one of them had even seen a photograph before. Hill and Adamson carefully delineated each of them; their overlapping postures manage not to obscure a single head.

Working for the National Child Labor Committee, Hine made thousands of pictures of children at work--in Southern mills, glass factories, fish canneries, tenements, and fields. He recorded their names, their heights, the hours they worked, the money they spent, and such descriptive details as \"out past midnight\" or \"smokes cigars.\" Hine was one of the first photographers to document the exploitation of child labor, a product of rapid industrialization and urbanization at the beginning of the 1900s.",

Like most of his late bilingual eye-cups, this black-figure tondo bears the inscription, \"Memnon is beautiful.\"The figure painted in the tondo has no distinguishing attributes to aid identification. He is nude, except for a mantle thrown over his left shoulder and right arm. Touches of added red, an old-fashionedmotifused in black-figure and characteristic of Oltos, embellish alternate folds of the mantle, as well as sections of the man's hair and beard. Like the figure in the tondo, the red-figured youth on the exterior of the cup is anonymous, in his case entirely nude except for a purplish added-red wreath around his head.Bilingual vases were developed as a style of vase decoration in Athens around 525 B.C. They combine the two traditional Athenian vase-decoration techniques: the older technique of black-figure, and red-figure, the technique that would gain popularity and continue to be used through the fourth century B.C. On a black-figure vase, silhouettes in black gloss are contrasted against the red-orange clay of the vessel. On a red-figure vase, the forms come from the red-orange color of the clay, and the space around them is filled in with black gloss. Like most bilingual cups, this is an eye-cup, with large eyes painted on the red-figured exterior and a single black figure on the tondo of the interior. Red-figuredpalmettesappear at the handles, and a single red figure occupies the space between the large eyes on one side.",

        "description": "'Pearblossom Highway' shows a crossroads in a very wide open space, which you only get a sense of in the western United States. . . . [The] picture was not just about a crossroads, but about us driving around. I'd had three days of driving and being the passenger. The driver and the passenger see the road in different ways. When you drive you read all the road signs, but when you're the passenger, you don't, you can decide to look where you want. And the picture dealt with that: on the right-hand side of the road it's as if you're the driver, reading traffic signs to tell you what to do and so on, and on the left-hand side it's as if you're a passenger going along the road more slowly, looking all around. So the picture is about driving without the car being in it.Thus David Hockney described the circumstances leading to the creation of this photocollage of the scenic Pearblossom Highway north of Los Angeles. His detailed collage reveals the more mundane observations of a road trip. The littered cans and bottles and the meandering line where the pavement ends and the sand begins point to the interruption of the desert landscape by the roads cutting through it and the imprint of careless travelers.",

        "description": "Most photographers think that the rules of perspective are built into the very nature of photography, that it is not possible to change it at all. For me, it was a long process realizing that this does not have to be the case.When making his two photocollages of Pearblossom Highway, David Hockney positioned himself closer to or more distant from his subjects, choosing which elements in the scene should be large and which should be small. By reassembling views from multiple perspectives, he applied ideas borrowed from Cubist painting to produce a rich, compound image that he considers \"a panoramic assault on Renaissance one-point perspective.\"Hockney made this work as a preparatory study for the final version,Pearblossom Hwy., 11 -  18th April 1986, #2,which measures approximately six-and-a-half by nine feet. Aside from scale, the principal differences between the two versions are the distortion of the stop sign in the foreground and the left and right edges of the composition.",

From 1561 to 1562, Georg Bocskay, the Croatian-born court secretary to the Holy RomanEmperor Ferdinand I, created thisModel Book of Calligraphyin Vienna to demonstrate his technical mastery of the immense range of writing styles known to him.About thirty years later, Emperor Rudolph II, Ferdinand's grandson, commissioned Joris Hoefnagel to illuminate Bocskay's model book.  Hoefnagel added fruit, flowers, and insects to nearly every page, composing them so as to enhance the unity and balance of the page's design. It was one of the most unusual collaborations between scribe and painter in the history ofmanuscriptillumination.Because of Hoefnagel's interest in painting objects of nature, his detailed images complement Rudolph II's celebratedKunstkammer,a cabinet of curiosities that contained bones, shells, fossils, and other natural specimens. Hoefnagel's careful images of nature also influenced the development of Netherlandish still life painting.In addition to his fruit and flower illuminations, Hoefnagel added to theModel Booka section on constructing the letters of the alphabet in upper- and lowercase.",

On this page Bocskay presented a Latin prayer, beginningDeus(God), employing an elaborate angular script, gold filler for the last line, and ornate flourishes above and below the text.Thirty years later, when illuminator Joris Hoefnagel painted the blank space left at the bottom of the page, he carefully coordinated his image with the script already on the page. Hoefnagel painted a pear, caterpillar, centipede, and hover fly in colors that harmonize with those of the text. The contrast between the yellow and ochre of the moth, hover fly, and pear and the black of the caterpillar echoes the contrast between the gold used for the initial and the decorative filler and the black ink used for the majority of the text.

At the top of the page, theXPS(Chi-Rho-Sigma) monogram for \"Christus\" in the azure medallion suggests the dominion of Christ over the world, represented by the maps of the continents on the sides. Echoing this idea, at the bottom of the page Hoefnagel included a verse from Psalm 56:Exaltare super caelos deus et in omnem terram gloria tua(Be exalted above the heavens, God, and your glory through all the earth). The two columns call to mind the so-called Pillars of Hercules, Habsburg imperial symbols since Emperor Charles V had used them in his emblem.

Although showing the uniqueness of each of these specimens was undoubtedly important to Hans Hoffmann, he equally tried to portray the individual beauty of each flower and insect. He placed the peony, two species of irises, an amaryllis, a may beetle, and a june bug in an attractive arrangement on the page. He drew the delicate forms carefully and added lush color in a palette of green, blue, and red. He used plain black chalk to represent the shadow cast by the beetle's body, illusionistically raising the beetle's legs off the ground with this trompe-l'oeil effect.Hoffmann may have intended this arrangement of nature studies to be hung as a painting, since it was listed as such in the archives of its original owner and it remained in a frame until well into the 1800s.

Unlike the darkness one would expect to find in a forest, Hans Hoffmann painted a theatrically illuminated scene. Each plant and insect--snail, cricket, beetle--is seen in vivid detail. The finely wrought leaves of the thistle, the sprawling fronds of a plantain, and the bright blue flowers of the Hare Bell attest to Hoffmann's meticulous treatment of the subject. In fact, none of these plants could have co-existed in the natural world. Hoffmann imaginatively combined numerous individual nature studies in a single painting.Hoffmann's golden-brown hare is based on Albrecht D\u00fcrer's famous and influential watercolor which, much like hisStag Beetle, shows a hare against a plain ground. Hoffmann had seen D\u00fcrer's hare while in Nuremburg. Later, when he went to work in the court of Emperor Rudolf II, he helped the Emperor acquire the watercolor for hisKunstkammer. Hoffmann's hare differs from D\u00fcrer's however, appearing amid a striking arrangement of elegant plants and insects. At the time it was painted, this arrangement of nearly life-size subjects was entirely unique, not only within Hoffmann's body of work, but also within the tradition of German nature study.",

In this second stage, Holbein made several changes in the outline of the hat and the cloak just behind the sitter's head. He used a soft red chalk over the pink ground of the paper to model the face subtly.Holbein became painter to the court of King Henry VIII of England in 1536. After the artist's death in 1543, numerous drawings of members of the court were found in his studio.

The choice of an animal for the main decoration of the cup is somewhat unusual for Lakonian work. Unlike theCorinthianvase-painters, the Lakonians generally shunned the animal style in favor of scenes of people and mythology. The use of the animal style here probably reflects the general decline of Lakonian vase-painting in the mid-500s B.C.",

According to a prophecy, Saturn would be overthrown by one of his sons. In response, he ate his sons as soon as they were born. But the mother of his children, Rhea, hid one child, Zeus. Later, Zeus gave his father a potion, forcing him to regurgitate his siblings; he then vanquished his father and ruled over earth, fulfilling the prophecy. Saturn's cannibalism is graphically shown here: in his left hand he holds a bone from one of his already eaten children while he partially ingests the child in his arm.Simon Hurtrelle represented Saturn as a powerful, yet elderly figure with wings. The wings suggest the speed of time and derive from the association of Saturn, also known as Cronos, with the Greek god of time, Chronus. Similarly, Saturn's loss of hair indicates the passing of time. The composition of the bronze was inspired by an antique Roman marble sculpture that Hurtrelle saw in Rome.",

Arranged in a terracotta vase displaying an antique relief, Jan van Huysum included flowers from all seasons of the year--roses, anemones, hyacinths, tulips, and more--and painted them directly from life. The flowers' nearly overripe quality attests both to nature's bounty and its transience. The bouquet is ordered in a loose pyramidal shape, with flowers and greenery almost bursting to be free of the vase. Butterflies and other insects fly or crawl amongst the arrangement, and drops of water are visible on leafs and shiny petals.Van Huysum painstakingly applied layer upon layer of thin oil glazes to capture the brilliant colors and delicate textures of the blossoms.

A great interest in botany arose toward the end of the 1500s, when collectors of herbs and plants were spending fortunes on their gardens; their desire for portraits of their prized possessions fueled the popularity of flower painting. Later on, Dutch still lifes were eagerly taken up by French painters and collectors and came to decorate the most fashionable Frenchsalons.Like Jan van Huysum himself, this follower of Huysum embraced many different species in his composition, including flowers that do not bloom in the same season. While Van Huysum usually intended his ephemeral blossoms to convey aVanitasmeditation on the fleetingness of life, this artist's purpose was probably largely decorative.

Even the tattoo is a highly coded element; it depicts Mexico's patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe--also calledLa Virgen Morena, or the brown-skinned Virgin. Some speculate that Mexico's indigenous Virgin of Guadalupe has roots in the Aztec mother goddess Tonantzin. The characteristic wavy, pointed tendrils that surround her evoke rays of holy light. However, these are also thought to refer to something organic, namely the spiked agave plant, which Mexicans ferment intopulque, mezcal, and tequila--alcoholic beverages enjoyed on the Virgin of Guadalupe's feast day.Like her mentor, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Iturbide is known for photographs that explore the diversity of her native Mexico, especially its indigenous peoples. In this particular image, Virgin of Guadalupe's likeness might function as a symbol of pride, identity, or even as a protective talisman in a difficult world.",

His pictures, combined with extensive reports from the government-sponsored expedition, moved the United States Congress to designate the area a national park in 1872. Jackson captured Old Faithful geyser with a mammoth-plate camera, which exposed negatives that are the same size as this print. He included a figure at lower left to convey the enormity and heighten the romanticism of this awesome natural phenomenon.Old Faithful, a geyser that throws about ten thousand gallons of water and steam up to one hundred seventy feet in the air, was so named in 1870 by the Washburn-Langford-Doane geological expedition because it seemed to spout \"faithfully\" for about five minutes every hour or so. In actuality, the eruptions occur more irregularly, with intervals varying from as much as half an hour to two and a quarter hours.",

The area featured guest accommodations beginning in 1859, when one clever developer built his home, store, and cottages into live redwood trees and stumps. With the expansion of the railroad, wilderness areas became increasingly accessible to the traveling public. Many resorts sprang up along the California coast, but Santa Cruz was one of the most beautiful and most desirable destinations. Big Tree Station, named for Santa Cruz's large redwood trees, was part of the Southern Pacific Railroad.

To achieve this efficiency, rails had to be level, so engineers built bridges, trestles, and tunnels to facilitate an even path. William Henry Jackson made this photograph standing in one such engineering achievement--a tunnel for the Colorado Midland Railway. He positioned his camera so that the craggy mouth of the tunnel created a natural frame for a well-dressed group of passengers assembled on and around a train's caboose, with the mountains beyond.

Seated at the center of the table, a woman clutching her glass shrinks from the brazen advances of a drunken man. On the left, a man throws his arms in the air, abandoning himself to song and capturing the attention of a dog whose paws rest in his lap. Other singing men surround the table, accompanied by a bagpipe player in the rear. On the far left, an intoxicated fellow has knocked over the crockery and is vomiting.Jacob Jordaens heavily worked this drawing with gouache and watercolor to create a rich finish that reflects the earthy humor of the subject. Using broken, angular lines and a delicate balance of light and shadow, Jordaens imbued his figures with movement and depth.Jordaens's raucous scene may have served to illustrate a popular proverb of the 1600s: \"Ill gained, ill spent.\" Like many Dutch artists of his time, Jordaens depicted moral sayings in many of his drawings and in a set of tapestry designs that was purchased by the governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1647.",

When Augustus placed the order for these porcelain animals, the Meissen factory was still of very limited experience, having only discovered the formula forhard-paste porcelainabout twenty years prior. The figure was modeled by Johan Joachim K\u00e4ndler, a sculptor who was hired by the manufactory in 1731 to assist with the commission for the animalsProducing such large figures presented a number of challenges for K\u00e4ndler and the Meissen craftsmen. The clay's thickness and weight and uneven shrinking frequently caused the animals to crack and collapse in the kiln. This turkey, along with all other sculptures for Augustus, was originally meant to be painted in the animal's natural colors; however, doing so proved technically impossible.

As I wandered farther and higher up in the building, I ended up in the huge attic...the clock was under the cupola. Its glass face with Roman numerals gave me this fantastic view onto the Pont des Arts with the Louvre behind it.--Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9szLooking at this photograph simulates a feeling of standing beside the photographer, looking out on a wintry Parisian cityscape. Through Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz's careful juxtaposition, the clock's silhouetted Roman numerals and hands appear to align with various elements of the scene below. The V points to the statue's shadow, the IIII traps two pedestrians, the III rests atop magazine stands flanking the Seine, and the star shape on the clock's hand blocks the far end of a bridge crossing the river. Darker than anything else, the clock's numerals and hand appear to be cut out and collaged onto the print's surface, rather than a natural part of the scene.This photograph demonstrates Kert\u00e9sz's strategic use of flat, foreground elements against a deep background to suggest a sense of space.

Instead of a specific setting, he preferred to use a blank ground, which allowed him to arrange the insects and fruits according to shifting yet interconnected vantage points.Van Kessel probably made this tight drawing in the studio, based on close sketches from nature. He used bodycolor to show volume, as in the luminous, patterned wings of the moths. Transparent washes represent the light effects, cast from a light source that creates dark shadows along the right sides of wings and underneath the insect's bodies, lifting them from the ground.

Leading vase-painters decorated these prize amphorae, which were commissioned in large quantities by the state, and their work can often be differentiated by themotifthey used to decorate the shield of Athena. For example, the Kleophrades Painter always used the winged horsePegasos, as seen here. The back of the vase depicts the four-horse-chariot race, one of the most prestigious events in the games.",

The panel on the shoulder of this Athenianred-figurekalpis, however, shows a group of youths in a moment of relaxation. Accompanied by their dogs, the youths are conversing, either leaning on walking sticks or sitting, while one leans forward to tie his sandal.The kalpis was a new vase shape in the early 400s B.C. The rounded profile replaced the older, more angular form ofhydria, or water jar. Early in his career, the Kleophrades Painter decorated the angular form of hydria, but he later switched to the kalpis. Other features, such as the depiction of a scene from everyday life and the type of ornament framing the panel, also suggest that this vase comes from the later phase of the Kleophrades Painter's career.",

Both the painting and this drawing mark a major turning point in the evolution of Klimt's style. In their soft-focus handling, dreamlike atmosphere and pervasive eroticism, they reveal the influence of Symbolism, a key element in the art of the Vienna Secession, the avant-garde movement in which Klimt played a central role.The drawing is housed in a contemporary frame designed by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, a collective of artists and designers with close links to the Secession.

Many such life studies remained independent works of art, but others inspired paintings.These sketches of a kneeling woman, her generous buttocks thrust toward the viewer and her luxuriant hair cascading around her head as if caught by a current of air or water, ultimately served as preparatory drawings for the foreground figure in Klimt's paintingGoldfish(now in the Kunstmuseum Solothurn, Switzerland). In the finished painting, the nude retains this pose but turns her head to gaze impudently over her shoulder; Klimt initially titled it \"To my critics\" in reference to the controversy over three highly erotic murals he painted for the University of Vienna which had been attacked by the conservative press. The fluid, stylized treatment of the model's body and hair, which verges on abstraction, suggests his enduring identification of women with water--unbounded, immaterial and elusive--a common motif in his work.Although this drawing served as a study for another work, Klimt seems to have considered it a work of art in its own right. Not only did he sign it, he also published a reproduction of the right-hand figure in the Vienna Secession periodicalVer Sacrumin 1902; faint red pencil marks--cropping indications for the photographer--frame the figure.The drawing is housed in a facsimile of a frame designed by Klimt himself, exemplifying his commitment to the idea of theGesamtkunstwerk(total work of art).",

Yet Kniep overlaid Claude's legacy with the late 1700s concept of the Sublime, whose purpose was to inspire a noble and lofty awe by depicting powerful natural phenomena.Despite the drawing's large scale, Kniep rendered each element with a precision achieved, no doubt, by the \"sharpening and resharpening of the best English pencils\" that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had noted during their trip to Italy together in 1787 and 1788. Many of the detailed sketches Kniep made during the trip were the basis for his later, more finished, imaginary landscapes such as this one.

After proudly displaying his immense wealth, the king asks Solon to name the happiest man he has ever met. Solon does not name Croesus, instead responding that he could call no man happy until his life was so judged at its end and that humble people were often more content than the wealthiest kings. This moralistic tale, extremely popular in 1600s Holland, reflected the culture's ambivalent attitudes toward wealth and consumption.Nikolaus Kn\u00fcpfer used light to draw attention to the confrontation between the two figures.

When one of the babies died, both women demanded the remaining infant. To determine the truth, Solomon ordered his guards to cut the living child in half and give a portion to each. The real mother then rushed forward to prevent the act, so that her child might be spared. Onlookers with beards and exotic headgear, looking much likeRenaissanceEuropean Jews, observe the scene, while the other mother points to her dead child lying at the foot of the stairs.In this design for a stained-glass window, Kulmbach sketched the scene with a brush and wash before reinforcing it with ink lines. After the artist had produced such a design, known as acartoon, a glass specialist then cut and painted colored glass in shapes and colors according to the design or painted the scene on colorless glass panels.",

        "description": "Although he is standing in the midst of unrest, this San Francisco police officer appears fully composed. Dorothea Lange made this photograph of a labor strike while working with the economist Paul Taylor, who would become her second husband. Taylor was covering the General Strike of 1934 for the social welfare journalSurvey Graphic. At the time, most political discussions centered on labor issues, and artists like Lange felt compelled to get involved. Lange's interest in the plight of laborers began as she assessed the evidence of the Great Depression from her studio window. Late in life, Lange recalled that she could see the unemployed drifting about and pause as they wondered where to go next. She began making photographs outside her studio-of breadlines, labor demonstrations, and strikes like the one seen here. Though Lange said she initially \"did not have the slightest idea\" what she would do with images like this, she continued making them as a direct response to what she saw, eventually focusing entirely on what would become known as documentary photography.Gift of David and Marcia Raymond in honor of their father Paul Raymond",

Within twenty-four hours of making the photographs, Lange presented them to an editor at theSan Francisco News, who alerted the federal government to the migrants' plight.

Along with Lathem, several anonymous illuminators collaborated on this project, including the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy. In the 1480s, a series of additional prayers with miniatures by a French illuminator was added to the volume.",

With his cape blowing behind him and a foot on the back of one demon, Saint Michael waves his sword overhead while fending off another demon with his shield. In the sky above, more demons fly in to attack amid storm clouds. According to the Apocalypse, Saint Michael is the archangel who will banish the devil at the end of time. At the top of the miniature, in a heavenly realm glowing with light, angels hold aloft an empty throne destined for the Messiah at the end of time.The illuminator Lieven van Lathem used the border to amplify the theme of the main scene. Here fantastic beasts frolic; similar to those in the miniature, their confrontations mimic the miniature's battle theme.Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy and a military leader, expressed his devotion to Saint Michael by including a suffrage prayer to him, prefaced by this miniature, in his personal prayer book.",

While in jail, she prayed to God to show her the enemy who was fighting her, and a great dragon appeared and swallowed her whole. While inside the beast, Margaret made the sign of the cross, at which point the dragon's belly burst open and she emerged unscathed. This image of Margaret rising unharmed from the belly of a dragon accompanies the suffrage of Saint Margaret. A golden cross appears above Margaret's clasped hands, a symbol of her faith and a physical representation of the sign she made while inside the dragon.Saint Margaret was a popular saint in the Middle Ages, often invoked by women in childbirth.

These episodes may have inspired both the unusual half-length form of this representation and the oval plinth, which recalls the shape of a cauldron.

Though no seam can be found between sea and sky, viewers speculated that this image, like other seascapes by Le Gray, was acombination print. In the 1850s, it was virtually impossible to render both sea and sky in the same negative. If the photographer exposed the film so that the sea or land was fully rendered, the sky would be overexposed and appear white; if exposed for the sky, the sea or land would appear dark as a silhouette. As it happened, the luminosity of the cloud-laden sky was equal to that of the water, making it possible for Le Gray to render each area exquisitely in a single negative.

This composition is far more geometric than many of Le Gray's seascapes. The lighthouse and jetty divides the picture vertically into two nearly equal halves, just as the line of the sea and sky splits it horizontally. The waves lapping onto the pebble beach and the billowing clouds, both of which advance to the right, infuse this brooding image with a dynamic sense of movement.",

        "description": "Active scenes in nature, such as a moving boat and waves breaking on the rocks, had never been photographed before, but Gustave Le Gray was an indomitable innovator whose technical improvements to the medium shortened his exposure times. What he could not improve upon, however, was the simultaneous exposure of sea and sky. Given photography's chemical limitations at that time, if he exposed the negative so that the sea was rendered clearly, the sky would be so overexposed as to appear empty. If he exposed for the sky, the sea and shore would appear only as silhouettes. In this composition, he opted to let the sea and land dominate. In reality, the blowing sails and choppy waters indicate a more tumultuous sky than the one seen here.Around 1855 Le Gray began to make a series of seascapes and maritime studies. This view was made at S\u00e8te, a Mediterranean port in southern France; it was taken from roughly the same position on the bank asLe Grande Vague, S\u00e8te(The Great Wave, S\u00e8te). This print's vertical format, the only one among Le Gray's many seascapes, emphasizes the boats' blowing sails.",

As was characteristic of the Rococo period, the sculpture is a subtle work with no large movements or heroic story. A restrained sensuality of delicate curves and flowing drapery dominates as the sculptor focused on small variations of texture and line. He contrasted, for example, the complex shape and rough texture of the striated rock with Venus's smooth skin and simple open forms.

During his occupation of Milan, Astasius ordered his soldiers to arrest any Christians they could find. His soldiers dragged two brothers, Gervais and Protase, before the general, who ordered them to be killed when they refused to make sacrifices to the godJupiter.Eustache Le Sueur captured Astasius at the moment when he turns to watch the presentation of Gervais and Protase. Le Sueur drew this monumental figure with a combination of vigorous sketching and precise definition. While the chalk lines on the left side of the figure are free and loose, on the right, the artist painstakingly depicted the drapery folds, using hatching and smudging to create the dark creases.In March 1652 the churchwardens of the church of Saints Gervais and Protase in Paris commissioned six tapestries from Le Sueur about the lives of the saints. This drawing was one of several studies made for an enormous multi-figured tapestrycartoon. The artist delivered the final design to the tapestry manufactory in May 1653.",

This scene of Ajax and Achilles gaming was very popular in Athenian vase-painting of the late 500s B.C. and was a favorite of the painters in the Leagros Group. Many scholars believe that this mythological scene also served as a contemporary political parable on the value of staying alert, since the tyrant Peisistratos had been able to take control of the city of Athens while the army was distracted. The back of the vase depicts three hoplites, or warriors, in a line. Such files of hoplites are rather unusual in vase-painting, and this depiction may have been meant to relate to the scene on the front of the vase. These hoplites may be Greeks on the march to counter a Trojan attack, while Ajax and Achilles are notified by Athena. Such an interpretation would explainAthena'sunusually prominent position on this rendition of the scene.",

The traditional title of the drawing refers to a path in the Haagse Bos, a large forest around The Hague in the Netherlands.Although Jan Lievens produced this and most of his landscape drawings in the studio, he still managed to capture many minute details: the varied textures of leaves in sunlight, trees with delicate hatching on their trunks, and careful shading on the path to show the sunlight and shadows. Lievens used a rare and costly sheet of Japanese paper for this drawing. The slightly iridescent surface of the paper gives the composition an added warmth and rich sheen. Japanese paper was quite hard to find in the Netherlands during the 1600s, and the only other artist who used it often was Rembrandt, a friend and former colleague of Lievens.",

Ligozzi probably painted this sheet as part of a book devoted to figures in Turkish costume, many of whom are accompanied by animals. Rather than drawing from life, he used a variety of costume engravings.Ligozzi seems to have invented the idea of showing animals alongside the costumed figures. Throughout his book, the animals often act as commentaries on the figures or reflect physiognomic similarities; here, heads turned to the right and the finely drawn human and feline whiskers link the azappo and the cheetah.Ligozzi's patron, Francesco I de'Medici, probably commissioned the series. During the late 1500s, wealthypatronsinterested in science and exploration often hired artists to paint elaborate, colored illustrations offlora, fauna, and the peoples of foreign lands.",

This gesture communicated a particular message to medieval Catholics in Western Europe. It is part of an iconographic pose called in Latin the \"Maiestas Domini,\" or \"Christ in Majesty,\" to symbolize his role in presiding over the human souls of all time. Images like this decorated altar frontals in Romanesque churches as a somber reminder of the coming Day of Judgment.In this gilded copper representation, Christ holds a jeweled Bible and his feet rest on an ornate enamel plaque. This Christ in Majesty served as the centerpiece of an ensemble of 52 saint and apostle figures. Together they were commissioned for the high altar of a cathedral in Orense, Spain, a stop along a famous pilgrimage route. Artisans in Limoges, France, a renowned center for the production of enamel, created this plaque and its ensemble. Most of the surviving figures lack inset pieces of glass that decorate Christ's tunic, but have similar, bead-like eyes. Visually they all relate to one another, with highly ornamental enameled backgrounds, similar to the plaque at Christ's feet. Their patterns are also dark and light blue, with white, gold, green, and red-brown accents.This figure was formed from a single sheet of copper hammered on the reverse side to  create the raised design in front. Features such as the beard, mustache, and folds of the tunic are etched into its surface. Large areas of gilding have worn away, primarily on the raised surfaces, suggesting that this object was touched over many centuries by the faithful who prayed before it.",

Pietro Longhi drew both as preliminary studies for two female figures who stand beside each other in the center of a painting.Longhi appears to have had the final composition already in mind, since he drew this figure slightly larger than the other, anticipating the woman's position a little farther forward in the finished work. The shadows at her feet also correspond to her placement in the final painting.At the left margin, a few chalk markings are all that remain of a detail study for the woman's left hand. The rest of the image remains on the far right of the pendant drawing. Longhi drew various studies of heads on theverso.",

Vicente L\u00f3pez y Porta\u00f1a dynamically composed the figure of Sebastian, with one arm tied above his head and his other arm held by an attendant, in order to more clearly display the wounds on his upper body and to allude to the martyrdom ofChrist. Sebastian's bent leg reveals the bleeding gash from which Irene has already removed one arrow. As she leans toward Sebastian's knee, she carefully pulls the saint's flesh in order to extract a second arrow.

        "description": "The maiden Europa rests atop a white bull, unaware it is the god Jupiter in disguise. According to the tale in Ovid'sMetamorphoses, soon the animal will abduct her across the waves. Until then, she and her attendants festoon the seemingly innocent beast with flowers, while her blue drapery flutters in the breeze. In the upper right corner, a hazy poetic light illuminates her home city of Tyre, further evoking an idyllic antique world.Claude Lorrain is known for painting complicated images that achieve a tranquil balance. This scene appears bucolic, but his composition and details also hint of impending danger. Beyond the field of delicate flowers, for example, a craggy tower looms. The women fail to notice that the bull is poised in anticipation, already straightening one of his legs for flight. Whitecaps gather behind them on the darkening sea, the backdrop to Europa's fate.Even in his day, Claude was known for developing a style called the Ideal Landscape, in which nature on the canvas surpasses the real thing in its beauty, harmony, and refinement. Here he balances formal elements, like the upright trees, ship, and towers, against the open expanse of sea and sky. Offshore, he juxtaposes the huge galleon and all its impeccable detail in the rigging and carved decoration, with Europa still on land. The maritime theme also had a deeper resonance for Claude's contemporaries, as in art criticism, the abduction of Europa was compared to a ship leaving shore.French by birth, and working in Rome, Claude often went into the countryside to do studies of nature.  One of his hallmarks is the use of a unifying light, which gives this work a kind of gentle glow. The romance is punctuated by long shadows coming in from the left, distinctive of his favorite afternoon light, which help frame the drama at center stage.",

This region was a frequent subject for painters. Robert Macpherson himself made bucolic painted views of the Campagna before turning to the camera for this representation.The ruins that march across the rolling countryside are the remains of the Roman aqueduct built by the Emperor Claudius. Its abandoned, crumbling arches contrast with the signs of an active farming life in the foreground. Although Macpherson rarely included people in his photographs, the human presence is evident on the well-worn Via Appia Nuova, the ancient Roman road winding its way into and quickly out of the frame at the lower right corner. The farmhouse at the center right edge represents more current evidence of human activity. In his highly detailed rendering, Macpherson represented the coexistence of the historical past and present.",

Satyrs, part-human, part-animal companions ofDionysos, the god of wine, were a popular and fitting decoration for cups like this one intended for use at a symposion or drinking party. The decoration on this cup provides a good example of the reason that by the early 400s B.C. most Athenian vase-painters preferred to work in thered-figure technique. As this moving satyr shows, Greek artists of this period were extremely interested in accurately depicting the human body and its changes in musculature and posture. Theblack-figure technique, in which all internal markings were incised equally through the black silhouette of the figure, was inherently limited in its ability to do this. The red-figure technique with its painted internal detail was more suitable for the task.On this vase, Makron used heavy lines of black glaze, actually raised from the surface of the vase, for large contours of the body. He then applied lines of diluted glaze, which fired brown rather than black, for smaller musculature. This varied intensity of line enabled the artist to give a sense of mass and three-dimensionality to the satyr.",

Consuming the wine in the cup revealed the joyous dancer at its bottom. The circular area or tondo on the interior of a cup presented a compositional problem for Greek vase-painters. It was difficult to place upright figures in this limited, curving space. Some artists placed decidedly linear figures in the circular space or drew a line across the circle in order to create an artificial ground-line for their figures. Others, like the artist Makron on this cup, clearly were trying to work out innovative compositions.

The face, however, belongs not to a real woman but to a fashion mannequin who cries tears of glistening, round glass beads; the effect is to aestheticize the sentiment her tears would normally express. Man Ray made this photograph in Paris around the time of his breakup with his lover Lee Miller, and the woman's false tears may relate to that event in the artist's life.",

The forms, made of metal, wire, plaster, and wood and meant to illustrate algebraic equations, made a great impression on Man Ray, and he decided to photograph them.\"The formulas accompanying them meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature. The fact that they were man-made were of added importance to me,\" wrote Man Ray of these objects, which he used as points of departure for a series of twenty paintings that he made in Los Angeles.",

Thepicadoror  \"horse-master\" is caught helplessly between his mount and the wall while two spectators try to lift him to safety.Manet probably made this drawing at the scene of an actual bullfight. He used an energetic and gestural line to define the forms for the bodies of the bull and horse. Thin lines of black watercolor delineate the figures, and applied shades of color give three-dimensional form.

Manet's eyes saw both elegant passengers in hansom cabs and, in the foreground, a worker carrying a ladder. The hunched amputee on crutches, perhaps a war veteran or beggar, passes by fenced-in debris left from the construction of a new train track.

Ordinarily, they used a sharp quill pen and a fine pointed brush, which they handled with such control that the thinness of its strokes could rival or outstrip those of the pen.For this drawing, the artist prepared a red-brown ground, then drew the scene in black ink.

His perfectly hairless head, face, and body, the result of alopecia universalis, appear to take on a sculptural weight and dimension. The dark shadows of the background seem to lap at his neck, shoulders and under his arms, as if he emerges from a timeless, dark sea. The sophisticated lighting also sculpts the curves of his face, collarbone, and chest to further heighten their elegant forms.This figure study is part of a large body of work featuring African-American men. Mapplethorpe was absorbed by the texture and color of their skin, which he referred to as bronze. He used Agfa's Portriga 118 paper for its ability to produce the velvety texture and glow discernible in this reproduction. His strong, uncluttered compositions of statuesque male models fused a classical sensibility with homoerotic content at a time when the male nude was not a popular subject among camera artists.",

There are certain pictures I've taken in which you really can't move that leaf or that hand.--Robert MapplethorpeMapplethorpe presents a tulip, a staple subject of still lifes for centuries, but approaches it in a distinctive way. By choosing to capture the flower in profile, rather than from what would be the intuitive, vertical sightline, Mapplethorpe imbues the image with a sense of motion. The arc of the stem bows below two outstretched leaves, as if floating up or down on wings.After his beginnings with Polaroid portraits, Mapplethorpe refined his style and process in the early 1980s. Drawing on his knowledge of the 19th-century photographs he collected, he used simple compositions and careful lighting to great effect. Considered a central figure in late 20th century photography, his subjects span elegant figure studies, delicate floral still lifes, glamorous celebrity portraits, and the S&M; community.",

At the base of this image of a calla lily, he punctuates the wide planes of black and white with what seems a decadent surprise: the three-dimensional, curving lip of the flower's edge. He explores the effects of light as a painter might experiment with a palette of colors. At the top, the flower glows milky white, reminiscent of light seen through delicate alabaster or porcelain.Mapplethorpe's spare compositions often showcase familiar subjects in unusual ways. Floral still lifes, for example, have long encouraged sexual interpretations, and especially here, given the artist's other work with erotic and sadomasochistic subjects. His imagination transformed and energized what some had considered a stale genre.",

According to Greek mythology, Boreas brought Orithyia to Thrace, where the two reigned as King and Queen of the Winds.To decorate the corners of Charles LeBrun's never-completed garden at Versailles, the Parterre d'Eau, Louis XIV commissioned four monumental marble groups representing mythological abductions, each featuring three figures and symbolizing one of the four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. This bronze, with Boreas as a personification of the North Wind representing Air, is based on Marsy's preparatory model for one of these statues. Since the garden was never built as planned, Louis XIV commissioned bronze reductions, or smaller scale copies, of Marsy's work and Fran\u00e7ois Girardon's statue to form a pair for his Salon Ovale in the palace of Versailles.

A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.",

Christ's facial type, the authority of the Lord's gaze, and the expressive breadth and weight of the mantel are particularly characteristic of van Eyck.Although Christ stands on a tiled floor that seems to recede, creating a shallow three-dimensional space, the background is composed of a flat, highly decorative checkered pattern.In the short prayer accompanying the image, the petitioner makes an unusually generous appeal to God to pardon his enemies.

This compilation is called theHistorical Biblebecause the commentaries stressed the role ofscriptureas a record of historical events. Thus, in most illuminated copies, the book ofGenesis, the first of the historical books of the Bible, is profusely illustrated, while non-historical books, like those of the prophets, receive only oneilluminationeach.

        "description": "Cosimo de' Migliorati, bishop of Bologna and a cardinal, commissioned this luxuriously decorated missal. It was made sometime between 1389 and 1404, the year in which he was elevated to the papacy as Innocent VII. A missal contains all the texts used for celebrating Mass, including all the chants sung by the choir but without musical notation. Only the musically elaborate portions sung by the celebrating priest are supplied with notation, suggesting that this book was designed to be used by the cardinal himself at the altar as he celebrated Mass. The elegant illuminations of the missal, consisting of decorated calendar pages, numerous historiated initials, ornamented borders, and miniatures, place the book within the tradition of Bolognese manuscript illumination. The manuscript's anonymous illuminator, known as the Master of the Brussels Initials, was trained in Bologna, a city whose book trade flourished due to the prestige and growth of the university. The Master's work is characterized by the use of vivid colors, heavily modeled figures, and borders teeming with drolleries, beasts, and acanthus leaves.",

The calendar notes the feasts and holidays of the church year. Since the texts of the missal are arranged according to the order in which they were said during the church year, the calendar helped the priest to identify the appropriate prayers for each day. In this missal, the calendar pages are each identified by a zodiacal sign: Aries, indicated by the ram, roughly corresponds to the month of March. The illuminator also included the representation of a Labor of the Month, corresponding to an activity traditionally associated with a particular month. Here a peasant blows two horns, heralding the coming of spring.The illuminations on this page have a distinctive grace and simplicity. The artist drew from his close observation of nature for the graceful movements of the peasant, his softly falling drapery, and the ram's delicately extended front hoof. The artist also carefully harmonized the colors, using a limited palette of blue, red, brown, and gold to unify the page.",

The gold trim of the kings' cloaks contrasts with the simpler clothing of the attendants.

Adding to the sense that the scene is capturing a specific moment, the standing monks on the left sing from a choir book with open mouths.  The scene takes place in a groin-vaulted Gothic church. The varied poses of the figures, seen in profile, three-quarter view, and from behind, stress their volumetric presence in space. The Master of the Brussels Initials was particularly inventive in the construction of three-dimensional space.

In contrast, the nobles in the back are models of temperance: evenly spaced at the orderly table, their bodies rigid, they eat with great sobriety. Through this contrast theilluminatorsuggested that nobles are inherently more temperate, an interpretation that does not derive from the text.

Almost certainly made for a wealthy layperson for use in private prayer, the book contains the 150 psalms and other poetic texts from the Bible, preceded by a calendar indicating the particular saints and events to be remembered on each day of the year.The book's program of illumination originally consisted of large painted initials at Psalms 1, 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80, 97, 101, and 109, dividing the text of the psalms into ten sections. Regrettably, the initial for Psalm 1 was removed from the manuscript long ago and is now lost. The remaining nine initials constitute a stunning display of the achievements of the psalter's illuminator. Many of the initials feature King David, who is often shown acting out the psalm's opening verse.",

He calls before him one of the women he noticed among the Persian captives. As she kneels before him, he recognizes her as the niece ofArtaxerxes III, an earlier king of Persia. Alexander orders an attendant to return her belongings, which he passes to her in a wooden casket. He also orders a search for her husband, who may be the figure in the long blue robe in theforeground.This episode from the conqueror's history demonstrates Alexander's princely character, magnanimous even toward a captive because of her noble birth. Theilluminatorchose not to represent Quintus Curtius Rufus's description of Alexander's drinking at the banquet, because that would have been an example of debauchery indicative of Alexander's moral decline.In thisminiaturedepicting Alexander's court life, a blue and gold tapestry hangs on the back wall and Alexander sits at a richly set table on a raised platform.

A full-page miniature opens each of the book's major texts, with eight devoted to the Hours of the Virgin, the most important section of a book of hours. The suffrages, or prayers addressed to individual saints, are illustrated with a series of historiated initials.A number of artists participated in illuminating the manuscript, and in at least one example two illuminators collaborated on a single miniature, which required a high level of coordination. The anonymous artists known as the Master of the Llangattock Hours and the Master of the Llangattock Epiphany are both named for their work in this manuscript.",

One day, a lion entered the monastery where Jerome resided, causing his fellow monks to flee, but Jerome recognized that the beast was injured and he cured it by removing a thorn from its paw. The saint's monumental form fills the foreground of the composition, setting off the delicate gold tweezers Jerome uses to extract the thorn. In the background, a monk approaches with a pot of ointment and a bandage. The encounter between man and animal, in which Jerome comes to the lion's aid, is poignant, showing the moment when the lion submits to the saint, the saint's concentration as he removes the thorn, and the apprehensiveness of the attendant monk.This cutting likely represents a large miniature or initial from a gradual probably commissioned for the Camaldolese monastery of San Mattia in Murano. This manuscript was one of the most lavish and elaborately illuminated Lombard choir book commissions of the fifteenth century. The artist responsible for its decoration it is known as the Master of the Murano Gradual.

On the left, the apostle Peter raises his sword to cut off the Roman soldier Malchus's ear. Clad in bright green, this small figure falls awkwardly to the ground before Jesus. On the right, soldiers muscle in to arrest Jesus.Pushing, gesturing soldiers on one side and Peter's upraised sword on the other overlap the image's frame. The artist crowded the composition in this way to heighten the scene's emotion and tension. Collapsed at the miniature's bottom edge, the figure of Malchus plays an important role, extending the pictorial space into the unpainted margin and drawing the viewer into the painting in this tiny book.",

Despite her lowly pose, the anonymous artist or artists, known as the Masters of Dirc van Delf, reminded the viewer of the Virgin's lofty status as the Queen of Heaven by showing her crowned and celebrated by a music-making angel in the upper border. The theme of the Madonna of Humility became popular in the 1400s as Christians increasingly focused on the human qualities of holy figures. The artist(s) further emphasized the Virgin's humanity by representing her nursing the infant Jesus.The rubric,Incipiunt hore de domina n[ost]ra(The hours of our Lady begin), introduces the Matins text of the Hours of the Virgin, which begins with a verse from Psalm 50:Domine labia mea aperies et os meum annunciabit laude[m] tuam(Lord, open my lips and my mouth will declare your praise). An ornate, burnished gold leaf border with vines and bold blue and red leaves almost entirely encloses the text, including the initial.

Within this context, the miniature of Christ before Pilate serves as a visual focus for the prayers that follow. Pilate, the Roman prefect in Jerusalem who presided at Jesus' trial and gave the order for his Crucifixion, sits on a throne. Jesus' sad but patient expression suggests his acceptance of his fate.This confrontation between Pilate and Christ takes place within a shallow architectural setting much like a stage, with a flat, curtainlike, gold-patterned background behind. But the shallow space cannot contain the corporeal figures, who stand in front of the miniature's frame so that the figure of Jesus is presented both to Pilate and to the viewer. The solid weight of the figures and the frame contrasts with the delicacy of the fine sprays of leaves and flowers extending from the frame.",

The tender assistance of the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist draws attention to Jesus' wounds, stimulating the viewer's meditation on his sacrifice. His wounds are graphically rendered as open gashes dripping with blood. The saturated primary colors of the frame and draperies further set off Jesus' pale, emaciated body. Behind the figures, the pink cross picks up the faint, glowing hues of his suffering body. The full-page Lamentation appears within a sequence of images retelling the Passion story in this book of hours, the most popular type of private devotional manuscript of the later Middle Ages. The miniature of the Virgin and John mourning over the body of Jesus was particularly appropriate to a culture interested in devotional practices.

He was among the most important and successful artists of the beginning of the 1500s in Rome.

The exposition was a great success, attracting more than six million visitors during the five months that it was open to the public. The impressive structure, consisting of an intricate network of slender iron rods sustaining walls of glass, was built expressly for the exposition and was not intended to be permanent. The main body of the building was 1,848 feet (563 m) long and 408 feet (124 m) wide; the centraltranseptwas 108 feet (33 m) high. The Crystal Palace established an architectural standard for later international exhibitions, several of which were likewise housed in glass conservatories.John Jabez Edwin Mayall may have made this daguerreotype from the second tier in order to encompass the scale of the building. The full-grown tree in the image's center, which does not even reach the ceiling, gives a dramatic indication of just how large the building was.

Daguerre politely refused Meade's request but invited him to stay for a visit at his home in Bry-sur-Marne, France. Through the coaxing of either Madame Daguerre or Daguerre's niece, Meade secured the sitting. Daguerre's reticence, however, is apparent; he looks a bit uneasy and anxious for the whole ordeal to be over.During that visit Meade made five portraits of Daguerre, which he later exhibited in the galleries that were part of the Meade Studios in New York. They attracted a great deal of attention from Americans, who had enthusiastically embraced the daguerreotype soon after its invention early in 1839.

They interpret this scene as a mythical parallel for the tyrant Peisistratos's return from exile, when he was able to regain power because the Athenian army was unprepared for battle. If so, then these vases would be anti-Peisistratid propaganda, alerting Athenians to the importance of vigilance by reminding them of the consequences of their recent failure.The back of the vase shows a warrior departing for battle, standing between two old men.

The Meissen Porcelain Manufactory had been operating for only twenty years when Augustus commissioned this series of porcelain animals to be rendered \"in their natural sizes and colors.\" The production of porcelain models of this size had never been attempted before in Europe.Some of the technical difficulties Kirchner encountered in fulfilling this commission are evident on this figure of a fox with a chicken. First, the large scale of the figure required a number of highly visible vent holes to prevent explosions in the kiln. Second, shrinkage during the firing process and strong downward pressure from the objects' own weight caused cracks of varying severity. Meissen craftsmen tried numerous ways to reduce cracking; though they were certainly very inventive, few methods worked. The cracks made a final firing with enamel colors impossible, since this would have shattered the already cracked figures. Some were painted in oil colors, which became dull and discolored. In most cases the paint was removed at a later date. Traces of paint can be seen inside the pricked ears of this fox. In many ways, the successful creation of this life-size fox with a chicken attests to the Meissen manufactory's diligent attempt to satisfy one of the richest and most powerful men of the time.",

Messerschmidt sculpted them during the last thirteen years of his life, while apparently suffering from mental illness.This bust portrays a middle-aged man with a sour expression, which seems to fall somewhere between a grimace and a scowl. The most telling aspect may be the furrowed brow above squinting eyes and a scrunched nose. But natural cracks in the bust's alabaster surface seem to echo the topography of his skin, both softened by age yet hardened by the extreme expression. The man's receding hairline, wrinkles, and sagging jawline contrast with tensed cheek and neck muscles. Although the character seems to express irritation and annoyance, it is not certain whether Messerschmidt intended that interpretation, because he did not give the bust a title.This bust and the series it belongs to reflect the intellectual concerns of artists and scholars during the Enlightenment era, when a surge of interest in the sciences occurred. Studies in physiognomy were highly popular at the time. Perhaps as influential was Messerschmidt's undiagnosed mental condition, which could have been schizophrenia.

As in images dating from the Middle Ages, Christ has long hair parted in the center and a beard and moustache, and his sunken cheeks make him appear gaunt. These wide eyes and the intense expression evoke the pathos of tradition devotional images of Christ being led to his death, mocked, scourged, and finally crucified.Meunier's loose, sketch-like handling of the bronze, however, is thoroughly modern, reminiscent of Auguste Rodin's manner. To suggest the horizontal arms of the cross, Meunier extended the shoulders out to the sides; he also detached at the wrist the left hand that crosses the chest, leaving it as a particularly evocative fragment. The bust's truncation is similarly radical, with a jagged, cut-off edge ending in a massive, irregular base. Artists in the 1800s came to use this kind of jagged truncation as a symbol for the alienated artist. Here Meunier applied the symbolic content of the jagged cut to a traditional religious representation, expressing the idea that Christ was cast out by those whom he would redeem.",

During the later 1800s, many artists believed in a concept known assynesthesia: that color and sound were so closely related that color could stimulate the sensation of sound and sound could stimulate the sensation of color.At age twenty-six, in the same year that one of his pictures received great public acclaim, Michetti drew multiple self-portraits. His direct gaze, the proud angle of his head, and the bravura handling convey his self-confidence.",

In her left hand she holds a palette, brushes, and a small plaster sculpture that served as a model for larger works. Around her neck she wears a mask on a chain, which may refer to art's ability to deceive through the art of illusion.Frans van Mieris the Elder adopted the antique model ofPicturabut updated it for his time. The model is not classically beautiful or idealized; she is an average young woman observed from everyday Dutch life.Van Mieris the Elder was Gerrit Dou's most promising student in the school offijnschilders(fine painters) in Leiden in the 1600s.

The closed bud, however, displays the slightly irregular texture of the petals, and, unlike the open flower, appears darkest at the tips.

He said, \"For me a landscape hardly exists at all as a landscape, because its appearance is constantly changing; but it lives by virtue of its surroundings, the air and the light which vary continually.\"After beginning outdoors, Monet reworked each painting in his studio to create the color harmonies that unify each canvas. The pinks in the sky echo the snow's reflections, and the blues of the wheatstacks' shadows are found in the wintry light shining on the stacks, in the houses' roofs, and in the snowy earth. With raised, broken brushstrokes, Monet captured nuances of light and created a solid, geometric structure that prevents the surface from simply melting into blobs. The wheatstacks are solid forms, and, while the outlying houses are indecipherable close-up, they are clear from a distance.",

He painted there in late winter in both 1892 and 1893, then reworked his thirty canvases from memory in the studio through 1894. He began this example in 1893, working in an improvised studio in the front room of a dressmaker's shop across from the cathedral.After creating a coherent ensemble, Monet selected twenty paintings that he considered \"complete\" and \"perfect,\" including this one, for an exhibition at his Paris dealer's gallery in May 1895.

Once he had achieved the desired shape, one of Moore's studio assistants then carved a plaster mold of themaquetteto be sent to a foundry for casting in bronze.

A rich, golden surface, punctuated by bright highlights and dark caverns, enhances the sculpture's warm, protective quality. The horizontal form's hollows and curves, tarnished and hatched to emphasize depth, partly transform the figure into a glimmering, rolling landscape.This work combines several themes that preoccupied Henry Moore: the reclining figure, the relationship of mother and child, and the landscape. Moore began exploring the reclining figure motif in a series of drawings he made in the late 1920s--nearly sixty years before creating this sculpture. Despite his continued interest in this subject, the sculptor resisted attaching any specific or symbolic meaning to it.

Hercules killed the king in battle and fed his body to the horses, which tamed them. Gustave Moreau's fascination with violent, emotionally charged subjects portrayed in jewel-like colors typifies mid-1800s French painting.

Indeed, the two figures resemble dancers performing a ballet rather than opponents struggling for sexual conquest. With its jagged mountains, the hazy, mysterious landscape provides an eerie background.

Moreau described what he had in mind to the painting's first owner:I have tried to render the harmony that may exist between the world of nature at a certain time of year and certain phases of human life. The centaur seeks to embrace this white and graceful form, which is about to escape him. It is a last gleam, a last smile of nature and life. Winter threatens. Night is coming on. It is autumn.",

He achieved increased contrast by blocking out the sky area withpigmentand bleaching the deeply shaded section under the roof to more clearly show the mosque interior.The waxed-paper process was particularly useful for traveling photographers like Murray because the paper did not require immediate development. It also offered more translucency than other commonly used negatives. The process involved rubbing wax into the paper negative before it was sensitized and exposed.

Contending that all four of a horse's feet are off the ground simultaneously at some point while galloping, Stanford hired Muybridge to prove it photographically.Muybridge's first photographs of the horse were poorly exposed and thus inconclusive. After constructing a more efficient shutter and improving the speed of his film, he resumed his experiments with motion studies in 1877, but he was still producing only single images. Undaunted, he developed a system of first twelve and eventually twenty-four cameras, whose electro-magnetic shutter blades were opened by the stride of the animal tripping wires strung across the track. This series of twenty-four consecutive frames, which took less than one second to expose, was made after Muybridge had perfected his technique. Ultimately, Muybridge did prove that all four feet of a galloping horse were off the ground simultaneously.",

Inexpensive multiples offered for public sale, they often featured portraits of celebrities of the day--writers, musicians, actors--and were widely collected. Nadar's photograph ofSarahBernhardt (French, 1844-1923) as Ph\u00e8dre is from a collector's album of cabinet card portraits of Bernhardt by various photographers.A famous actress in the late 1800s, the \"Divine Sarah\" was a brilliant self-promoter at a time when the basis of celebrity was shifting from the political figure to the theatrical performer. Bernhardt pioneered the use of new technologies to disseminate her image: she was one of the most photographed women in the world, and the first major stage actress to star in films. She made several recordings of famous theatrical dialogues including a reading from Racine's Ph\u00e8dre at Thomas Edison's home.A recognizable figure, Bernhardt--often depicted in theatrical costume--endorsed commercial products. Contemporary with this cabinet card, her image appeared on cigarette cards, an early form of product promotion. Advertisements as well as collectable ephemera, cigarette cards like cabinet cards, reinforced Bernhardt's image in popular culture.",

In conversation he attributed his forty-year success to his having changed his mind every fifteen days, thus continuing to surprise the attentive audience of his weekly theatrical reviews.Scholars are undecided regarding the authorship of this portrait. For a brief period, Nadar and his brother Adrien Tournachon worked together in the latter's studio in the boulevard des Capucines. Three photographs of Janin wearing these clothes appear to have been made at a single sitting during this period. The three prints suggest a sequence of events in which Janin posed first for Adrien, then for both Adrien and Nadar, and then finally for Nadar alone. Janin's expression becomes progressively less friendly, perhaps due to a quarrel between him and Nadar or perhaps because his gout was troubling him. Nadar inscribed this print with Janin's name; it is probably the middle picture in the series, made by the brothers in collaboration.",

His left hand braces his body against the chair, while his right hand, cradling his chin and holding up his head, echoes the gesture of his left to create pictorial balance.This photograph was taken at mid-career; Nadar was already a celebrated writer,caricaturist, and portrait photographer.

Pr\u00e9ault's body turns to his right, his head slightly to the left, and his eyes farther to his left. His folded arms wrap around his body, momentarily holding in check his considerable physical and intellectual power, the better to be unleashed.By using strong overhead diagonal light to shape the large dome of the head and to cast half the face into shadow, Nadar emphasized the gravity of Pr\u00e9ault's presence.

She came to the studio somewhat reluctantly, citing her age and \"the cruelty of the sun.\" The resigned sadness of her weathered face bespoke not only climate but also the difficulties of her eventful life and the deaths of her brother, two sisters, two daughters, and most of her closest friends in recent years. Nadar focused the camera so carefully on her face and figure that the chair on which she sat and its shadow on the wall receded into the distance together.

Both emphasize, and in the case of the caricature exaggerate, the shape of Augier's most salient feature, his prominent nose.

Working as a clerk, he educated himself in French history and began to write.

Given Dumas's popularity, this mounted edition print, signed and dedicated by him, was likely intended for sale.Dumas is represented as a lively, vibrant man. The self-restraint of his crossed hands, resting on a chair that disappears into the shadows, seems like an attempt to contain an undercurrent of boundless energy that threatened to ruin the necessary stillness of the pose and appears to have found an outlet through Dumas's hair.

The son of a Parisian jeweler, he studied animal anatomy thoroughly in books, in laboratories, and at the zoo. When a lion died, he and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix dissected it. Here his stern visage reflects the notably taciturn man who, although he taught drawing, rarely spoke to his students, correcting their work simply by retouching. The overall effect of self-contained if melancholy dignity, of a man who has survived adversity and is beholden to no one, accords well with contemporary descriptions of Barye. His connection with Nadar was probably established through the painters who were friends of both. Barye was seldom photographed, and this image by Nadar, one of the few existing portraits, was later used as the basis for an etching.",

In his mid-sixties, the successful playwright wore elegant and expensive formal daytime clothing. He displays neither playfulness in his costume, as in some Nadar portraits, nor much liveliness of expression. The line of Scribe's mouth is so uncommonly straight as to give little idea of temperament. His left eye is mild and even, but his right eye arrestingly burns out from deep shadow, providing a clue to the anxiety that reportedly caused the playwright to gnaw on his handkerchief when a rehearsal was going badly.Scribe persevered in writing plays despite the failures of his first thirteen works. Critical and popular acclaim, and ultimately great wealth, rewarded his tenacious productivity in writing more than 230 plays and librettos, or texts for musical works. His work is now seldom performed, save for a few operas for which he wrote the librettos.",

In 1856 he was decorated with the Legion of Honor, whose insignia he appears to wear on his outer lapel.Nadar's portrait of P\u00e9rignon bears scant resemblance to the painter's own work, save for his elaborate wardrobe. He is sad-eyed, his expression nearly plaintive, and he has no illusions about the image of gentle fatigue he will present. Although not impatient, he perhaps wished the photographic process were over--despite its brevity when compared to the multiple sittings required for his portrait paintings.

Nadar's portrait of Millet perfectly corresponds with a contemporaneous description of him as \"a long, strong, deep-chested man with a full black beard, a grey eye that looks through and through you.\" Among his intimates, however, Millet was amiable and occasionally serene.Millet said of photographic portraiture that \"this art would never reach perfection till the process could be performed instantaneously and without the knowledge of the sitter. Only in that way, if at all, could a natural and life-like portrait be obtained.\" Although he sat for other photographers, Millet may have had the stern formality of Nadar's portrait in mind when he made this statement, perhaps having a milder self-image than this picture gives.",

Nadar seems to have placed the camera slightly lower than the subject's eye level, giving him added stature.Cr\u00e9mieux's contemporaries thought the sitter peculiar in both appearance and manner, although his wife disagreed, insisting that Nadar agree with her that her husband was handsome. At least in retrospect the photographer agreed, finding the man beautiful in the tenderness he inspired and merited but more truly--if unconventionally--beautiful because of his \"superior intelligence, infinite goodness, perpetual forbearance, love of justice, and above all the inalterable serenity of his pure conscience.\"Nadar offered this kind of oval print, an edition print, for sale in his studio.

Whether de Pr\u00e9maray's velvet smock belonged to him or to Nadar is uncertain, but it seems large for the writer's frail figure and the sleeves appear to have been turned back at the wrists, creating deep satin cuffs.On the back of his photographs, Nadar customarily wrote the professions of his sitters; he designated de Pr\u00e9maray as a theatrical critic rather than as the playwright he also was. The deep circles under de Pr\u00e9mary's eyes may be symptoms of the severe illness that soon necessitated a three-year course of hydrotherapeutic treatments. By 1859 the critic's precarious health had forced him to give up all kinds of writing, and he died nine years later at age forty-nine.",

His carriage erect, he looks thoroughly accustomed to holding himself in this formal posture.Because Nadar also photographed Serrano's successor Narvaez in full formal diplomatic regalia, he may have made the two photographs to commemorate the changing of the Spanish ambassadorial guard in September of 1857.

These ironic accounts encapsulated and celebrated the bohemian milieu in which both Nadar and M\u00fcrger were conspicuous figures.Nadar and M\u00fcrger's lives were entwined throughout the 1840s, their deep friendship ending only when M\u00fcrger, weakened by hardship and dissipation at the age of forty, died in Nadar's arms. Shortly afterwards Nadar joined two friends in writing a memorial book that included M\u00fcrger's letters. It may have been at this time that Nadar rephotographed his 1857 portrait of M\u00fcrger to make this tombstone-shaped print.

As Molin's right arm holds the cape across his body and his left is concealed beneath the garment, Nadar must have been the one who puffed up the end of his cravat to provide an additional flourish of white fabric at the neck.

Women's clothing of the 1860s, particularly the fashionable, enormous crinoline skirts, was clearly unsuitable for balloon ascensions, so she adopted men's clothing tailored to her specifications, including a soft-brimmed bowler hat into which her hair could be tucked. Among her accessories in some of these nine poses are what appear to be a case for binoculars and the anchor for a balloon, used to attach to a tree or the ground when descending.",

He hoped that circulation of these images of him seemingly rising into the sky in the gondola of a balloon might attract more paying spectators to the balloon ascensions he staged. Since cartes-de-visite sold for low prices, their sale alone would not have produced enough income to defray aeronautical expenses. Instead, they were likely given away as publicity, although Nadar used the back of this one to write a note urging his assistants to make a certain Madame Grandet at home in the studio.These photographs were a mixture of self-aggrandizement and profitseeking and, at least to a modern eye, also humorous for their incongruities. The woven basket in which Nadar posed was probably a laundry hamper suspended on ropes in the studio--too small to carry a man comfortably for any distance, particularly kneeling, as the five-foot-ten Nadar must be doing. To give a modest illusion that he was flying, he posed his pretend balloon against a painted backdrop of clouds. He may have chosen dandyish clothes in order to imply that ballooning was a safe, even gentlemanly enterprise, in which money could be judiciously invested. His binoculars advertise the view to be had from on high, and the anchor adds a note of authenticity.",

While in exile with Hugo and his family on Jersey, Vacquerie continued to write, grew the beard he wears in Nadar's portrait, and, having learned photography from Hugo's son Charles, made a series of photographs documenting the family and the local landscape. Thus for a short time Vacquerie was a photographer, one of the very few whom Nadar photographed.In order to compete with painted portraits, photographers of the 1850s and 1860s frequently employed artists to embellish their images. Nadar was not an exception in this practice, although few painted photographs from his studio have survived. In this example, variously dense layers of reddish-black ink cover almost the entire surface of the print, with the overall effect of coarsening the image. Although the ink has been skillfully applied, particularly in the hair and beard, the subtlety of expression around Vacquerie's eyes has been lost and the shape of his mouth distorted. The retoucher radically changed the shape of Vacquerie's left sleeve by painting out a billowing wrinkle in order to simplify the silhouette. With his photographic sensibilities, Vacquerie may have rejected the painted proof, causing it to remain in Nadar's studio.",

Her writing was celebrated for its frequent depiction of working-class or peasant heroes. She was also a woman as renowned for her romantic liaisons as her writing; here she allowed Nadar to photograph her, devoid of coquettish charms but nevertheless a commanding presence.This portrait is a riot of textural surfaces. The sumptuous satin of Sand's gown and silken texture of her hair have a rich tactile presence. Her shimmering skirt melts into the velvet-draped support on which she leans, creating a visual triangle with the careful center part of her wavy hair. The portrait details the exquisite laces, beads, and buttons of her gown, but her face, the apex of the triangle, is out of focus. Sand was apparently unable to remain perfectly still throughout the exposure, and the slight blurring of her facial features erases the unforgiving details that the years had drawn upon her.",

In the center, two imposing buildings housed government offices. In front of these buildings is a monumental bronze equestrian statue of Louis XV that was melted down for a cannon in 1792. As one of the great new public spaces in Paris in the 1700s, the Place de la Concorde was portrayed by many painters and engravers.",

These beams, as well as a third vertical form, have pointed tops suggestive of spears. Positioned on top of these beams, a single horizontal beam demarcates the tent's top edge. This snake-like form also insinuates violence: its gaping mouth, sharp fangs, and bulging eyes suggest that within the tent lies danger.Isamu Noguchi originally created this form as a stage set for choreographer and dancer Martha Graham's 1950 productionJudith. This sculpture is one of three bronze casts made from the balsawood original that appeared on stage. Graham'sJudithwas based on the biblical story of Judith and Holofernes. The widow Judith seduced and then decapitated the general Holofernes who was laying siege to her hometown. Noguchi's sculpture alludes to the tent in which Judith beheads Holofernes. The tent's phallic spears convey Holofernes' desire for Judith; the serpent form, the peril awaiting the doomed general.Noguchi created stage sets throughout his career. When working on a scenic design, he would often arrange the elements on a miniature stage. This allowed him to play with the formal and spatial relationships between the objects. Noguchi desired his three-dimensional forms to animate space and positively alter the viewer's experience of the environment.",

Norman had been experimenting with photography under Stieglitz's instruction for about six years when she made this image. Often regarded as the father of American photography, Stieglitz was an influential figure in Norman's life.

Oudry's landscape drawings, of which approximately one thousand still exist, combine a love of nature; a free, rapid drawing style; and a sensitivity to the effects of light.Here Oudry used white chalk sparingly for subtlehighlightson the tan paper. He created depth with a strong receding diagonal line and black chalk markings ranging from the darkforegroundto the lighter areas of the sky. Scholars are uncertain whether Oudry or a later artist added the figures.",

Many of these pictures were produced with considerable technical difficulties unknown to today's users of more recent and much simpler color materials. Each shot cost $150, and many hours of work were necessary to produce it. Three different shots with varying exposures had to be made with three different color filters. After this, three separate color images each one thousandth of an inch thick had to be transferred onto paper one by one and precisely superimposed one on top of the other.--Paul OuterbridgePaul Outerbridge described the practical and technical concerns with making this image, but what of the aesthetic impulse? The photograph has been cropped from the full negative, which included the model's face and slightly more of both arms, to this disturbing image of a woman piercing her own breast and abdomen with the sharp tips of meat packer's gloves. Although Outerbridge described the arduous carbro process, this photograph contains very subdued color. The realistic representation of flesh tone, however, and the lack of pubic hair--it was airbrushed out--make the nude subject even more shocking.",

Around 1400 B.C., however, artists, probably inspired by wall painting, developed a less common pictorial style of pottery decoration. Bulls were frequent subjects on this pictorial pottery, and the man grasping the bull by the horn on this jar may be a bull jumper. Bull jumping, a ritual performance that originated in the Minoan culture on Crete, involved literally grabbing the horns of a bull and somersaulting over its back. If this man was a bull jumper, the sphinx and the pomegranates may indicate an unsuccessful leap resulting in his death, since they had funerary connotations in later Greek art.Most Mycenaean pictorial pottery has been found in the eastern Mediterranean, especially onCyprus. In the 1300s and 1200s B.C., Mycenaean Greeks exerted a strong influence over Cyprus.

This pottery, known as South Italian, grew directly out of Athenian shapes, style, and subject matter. The colonists quickly developed their own variations, inventing new shapes, finding their own styles, and depicting subjects not otherwise found in Greek art.

The god sits on a chair with a cloak wrapped around his legs holding aphiale, or offering dish, which contains three white objects, perhaps eggs. The term phlyax is used for both farces parodying the heroes and themes of mythology or the comic elements of everyday life and for the actors who performed them. These plays were popular in the 300s and 200s B.C. in the Greek colonies in Italy. The term phlyax probably derives from the Greek verb \"to swell\" and finds its meaning in the actor's costume of a mask, tights, a padded tunic, and a large artificial phallus. On the outside of this cup, set on a low disk foot, a seated woman holding another phiale with eggs faces a kneelingErosholding a fillet or ribbon. On the other side, a similar scene is depicted. A nude boy kneels before a woman holding a phiale and a mirror.This cup represents a change in the theatrical scenes that were so popular on South Italian pottery. About 360 B.C., painters shifted from depicting scenes from plays to alluding to the theater by showing either an actor or Dionysos.",

Light diagonal lines create the open atmosphere of the sky, while darker cross-hatching shapes the substantive parts: David's muscular body, his fluttering cape, and the ground behind him.Parmigianino used sure yet delicate contours to define David, but Goliath's head is a mass of wispy, waving lines of beard and hair providing the flimsiest of outlines. He suggested Goliath's sunken eyes with quickly jotted marks and enhanced the thrusting effect of David's dynamic step forward with his billowing cape. The sure ink lines and lack of corrections display the artist's instinctive and prolific draftsmanship. \"He had no sooner taken a pen in his hand to learn to write than he began to draw marvelously,\" reported his biographer Giorgio Vasari.",

The back of the vase depicts a man and a woman who appear to be conversing. Chalkidian pottery was made by a workshop of immigrant Greek vase-painters who settled in Italy. Scholars call the style Chalkidian because some vases bear inscriptions written in the alphabet of the city of Chalkis in Greece. Through two generations of production in Italy, Chalkidian pottery remained thoroughly Greek in conception. For example, the depiction of a rider on this vase derived from the long-standing Greek use of the horse as a symbol of status and wealth. A painter's miscalculation on this vase sheds light on his creative process. On the front of the vase, the Phineus Painter first drew a set of lines marking out the panel for decoration. Then, he proceeded to paint the horse but found that the panel was too small and the horse's tail hung out over the edge. The last stage of vase decoration was to cover thebackgroundareas with black glaze. When the Phineus Painter reached this point, he had to accommodate the tail by creating a slanting area behind the horse rather than following his vertical guidelines.",

The strikingly angular form of the foot has led some scholars to believe that the shape of the cup may have been derived from metal prototypes. Eyes decorate the exterior of all Chalkidian cups. In Greek thought, large, staring eyes had an apotropaic power, that is, they had the ability to ward off evil and danger. The painted eyes on this cup may have protected the drinker, or the frontal face may have represented an abbreviated mask connected withDionysos, the god of wine.Scholars do not know precisely where Chalkidian pottery was made.

Reaching out and touching one another, the figures connect and draw the viewer's eye upwards. Unlike an academic study of the static male figure, however, this is a study of movement. The drawing illustrates how Piranesi worked out ideas about form and posture. In some ways, the lively figures are unrealistic. For example, Piranesi put little effort into describing their hands and feet, which seem to end abruptly or break off altogether. The jagged parallel shading in the body adds energy but indicates his lack of concern for muscular detail. The drawing may have formed part of a stock selection in Piranesi's workshop, from which he could later borrow images. He was known to enliven many of his compositions with human figures, although these particular figures have not been specifically identified with that purpose.",

In the foreground, a woman carrying a bucket pauses to talk with a young boy carrying his school satchel over his shoulder. The gray sky and the trees losing their leaves indicate autumn.Painting in the open air alongside Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pissarro followed a new practice of breaking up surfaces with loosely placed brushstrokes. This revolutionary technique, the cornerstone of Impressionism, helps to reveal how light and movement affect the perception of objects. Pissarro made the canvas a field of textures and movement; the character of the brushstroke varies according to the texture and form of the object it describes. For example, the haystack is painted with straw-shaped brushstrokes, the leaves are suggested by jagged daubs of paint, and the stucco walls are depicted with broad, smooth strokes.",

The pale blue-gray sky, streaked with clouds, and the sparse foliage, both on and fallen from the almost bare trees, also convey winter's approach. A single figure and, in the distance, a figure and carriage, move along the desolate road curving through the scene.Camille Pissarro's landscape shows the road to the town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye from Louveciennes, a village west of Paris. Many of Pissarro's landscapes of the early 1870s show the roads into and out of Louveciennes. Pissarro himself lived intermittently in Louveciennes and was part of a close-knit community of landscape painters who lived or traveled there including Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.During the early 1870s, Pissarro began experimenting with the emerging Impressionist painting style by returning to watercolor, a medium he had used as a student during the 1850s. Using black chalk, Pissarro first indicated the main features of the composition. He then fleshed out the scene by covering almost the entire sheet with watercolor. Pissarro experimented with some of the spontaneous effects of watercolor, allowing it to pool and tide in some areas and applying it more evenly in others to create a diffuse light. He used broad, wet strokes to define the sky and smaller strokes, with more pigment on the brush, to articulate the foliage and figures.Also in the Getty's collection, the paintingHouses at Bougival (Autumn)was made by Pissarro about one year before this drawing. Although they depict similar subjects, the two works explore different effects. Here, the artist focuses on the fleeting atmospheric effects of light and air; in the painting, Pissarro places more emphasis on the geometric properties of the houses in the landscape.",

Documentary in style, it portrays ordinary, deliberately mundane objects in Polke's studio.This arrangement of five mounted coat hooks with bent matches dangling from wires is a sculptural construction that Polke created for the purpose of photographing it. As demonstrated by the choice of uneven lighting and haphazard framing, the photograph reflects Polke's abiding interest in depicting visual information in ways that challenge conventional notions of artistic merit or beauty.",

He drew Saint Francis over a partially obliterated standing man with a staff in his left hand, posed frontally with his head tilted to the left.Pontormo also conserved paper on theverso, drawing a powerful image of the dead Christ with his head thrown dramatically backward, over a female figure in profile.

After conceiving of the composition of the fresco as a whole, he tried out individual figures. He may have used and reused aspects of the pose of this body for several of the fresco's figures.Biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote that Pontormo almost obsessively revised his ideas for this fresco; his many known drawings for the project attest to the search for perfection. In the foot and calf of this figure in particular, Pontormo approached the paper repeatedly, imparting almost nervous energy as he refined the lines. On the verso, the smooth outlines of the reclining figure skillfully match the relaxation and refinement of the pose itself. Pontormo ultimately transformed this figure's pose into that of a female attendant in the fresco.",

Ambiguous facial features indicate that Pontormo was more interested in the figure's posture than in a true likeness of an individual. Pontormo made this drawing as a preparatory study for a scene of the martyrdom of Saint Lawrencefor theCertosa del Galluzzo, a monastery outside Florence. However, it was Pontormo's pupil Bronzino who executed the finished fresco.Saint Lawrence is usually depicted as a young man. According to legend, Lawrence was a third-century Roman deacon who was responsible for distributing goods to the poor. When a greedy high-ranking official demanded that Lawrence give him the church's treasure, Lawrence presented a group of poor people, saying that they were the church's treasure. For this defiant act, he was arrested and tortured on a burning gridiron.  In the finished work, Bronzino made only small changes to Pontormo's composition.  Bronzino's figure lies on a gridiron and turns his head to the left, as he is crowned by a cherub. He holds a palm leaf in his left hand, an emblem of martyrdom. Pontormo's drawing probably provided Bronzino with a model for human musculature and proportions that artists strived to achieve in the 1500s.",

His direct stare and swaggering pose are strikingly poignant, given the smooth unlined face and slim body that betray him as no more than a teenager. As a portraitist, Jacopo Pontormo was renowned for his subtle, complex psychological studies; here he conveyed the naive arrogance and vulnerability of youth. Court painter to Duke Cosimo de' Medici, Pontormo pioneered the Mannerist style in Florence, initiating a new, sophisticated type of portraiture in which elegance and aristocratic reserve play key roles. The sitter's identity has been much discussed. The Florentine painter Giorgio Vasari noted that during the siege of Florence in about 1528 Pontormo painted a \"most beautiful work,\" a portrait of young nobleman Francesco Guardi as a soldier. Francesco's birthdate of 1514 would make him about the age of Pontormo's teenage sitter. Based on a Florentine inventory, Cosimo de' Medici himself has also been suggested as the painting's subject.",

From the very first day, I was overwhelmed by the scenery--both in prospect and in description grossly underrated. The monumental structure of the towering walls in variety and color defied comprehension.--Eliot PorterEliot Porter made his first rafting trip down the Colorado River through Glen Canyon in 1960. He became captivated by the region's beauty, and over the next decade, returned to it ten times to photograph its weathered trees, colorful rock formations, and hidden slit canyons. This image of a sheer sandstone wall in vivid shades of salmon and purple demonstrates Porter's keen observation of the region's unique beauty.In the early 1960s, the Sierra Club was in the middle of a campaign to stop construction of a hydroelectric plant on the Colorado River at Glen Canyon. Its director thought a book of Porter's photographs might be persuasive. Porter had already collaborated with the environmental organization on a publication that earned critical praise. In 1963, the Sierra Club and Porter published the bookThe Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado.Copies were sent to President John F. Kennedy and members of Congress. That same year, construction of the Glen Canyon Dam was completed, creating Lake Powell and flooding hundreds of miles of the river and its tributary canyons. Porter's Glen Canyon photographs became especially meaningful in the aftermath of the dam's construction, as a record of a lost national treasure. Glen Canyon lacked national park status and protection because it was \"the place no one knew.\" Although Porter's efforts did not stop construction of the dam, they did spur federal review of reclamation projects on western rivers and passage of the Wilderness Act.",

The trees are dwarfed and stunted. Tundra covers much of the interior; arctic and alpine wildflowers bloom in seemingly unlimited abundance in summer. But the most striking contribution to Iceland's plant life is its mosses.--Eliot PorterA consistent thread in Eliot Porter's photography is his scientific attention to detail; his ability to observe what often goes unnoticed. Iceland's luxurious mosses, which blanket the region instead of forests, first drew Porter to visit the island in 1972. This photograph displays their startling range of colors and textures. Rocks rounded and smoothed by river water are draped with splotches of rust, yellow, gold, and green.In 1972, the Sierra Club published Iceland, a portfolio of twelve dye transfer prints in an edition of 110. Porter also wanted to publish a book on the subject, but he could not find a publisher.  Undaunted, Porter persisted and seventeen years later, it was published. The book contains an essay by Porter's son Jonathan, who often traveled with him. In the foreword, Jonathan wrote: \"Iceland possesses a primordial quality, as if one were a time traveler viewing an earlier formative age of the earth.\" Porter's close-up views, like this one, convey that uniqueness.",

Paulus Potter, the finest Dutch animal painter of his day, described the horse with scrupulous attention to physical detail: the glossy sheen of its coat and mane, the watery moistness of its eye, and the sleekly elegant lines of the animal's body. At the same time, the artist imbued the horse with an individualized personality that combines wildness with acute sensitivity. Indeed, the animal seems to respond to the distant sound of the hunt transpiring in the middle distance.The meaning of the painting is twofold. It is probably a horse portrait, perhaps commissioned by the owner of the country house at the right. The closely observed rendering of this domestic animal implies the pride of ownership that a wealthy Dutch landowner might have taken in the possession of such livestock. On the other hand, the horse is untethered and seems to roam free. His immaculate grooming and position before cultivated fields, however, imply that the source of Dutch prosperity lay in the control that humans were able to exert over brute nature.",

The ordered composition and clear, golden light contribute toA Calm'sutter tranquility, while glowing, gem-like colors and fluid paint strokes enliven this scene of benevolent nature. Poussin's sketching campaigns in the Roman countryside with his friend and fellow landscape painter Claude Lorrain account, in part, for its fresh observation of cloud-scattered sky and grazing goats.Poussin painted a pendant to this painting,Landscape with a Storm,now in a museum in Rouen. Together their contrasting weather effects embody nature's changing and unpredictable relationship with man. Poussin painted these works for the Parisian merchant Jean Pointel, a friend a great collector of his landscape paintings.",

Made late in Poussin's life, this meticulously ordered composition reveals the artist's rational inclination.Poussin placed the Holy Family in an idealized landscape with sixteenth-century Italianate buildings. The Virgin Mary sits in the center, but the action focuses on the embrace shared by Jesus Christ and John the Baptist. To the left, Saint Elizabeth gazes steadily at Mary, perhaps foreseeing her future suffering. Saint Joseph leans against a wall and smiles approvingly at the scene below.Putti or infant boys pay homage to Christ by bringing gifts. One putto crosses his arms across his chest in adoration, and another putto kneels, spilling a basket of flowers on the ground before Christ. Others carry a ewer, a towel, and a basin of water, which may refer to the bathing of the child or to John's later baptism of Christ.In the middle distance a man ferries a woman across a lake, possibly alluding to the Holy Family's Flight into Egypt, a theme popularized by Poussin and others in the 1600s.",

She stands with her right hand modestly covering her pubic area while her left hand drops her garment on a vase. Her eyes were originally inlaid in a contrasting material, and she would have worn earrings.This Roman statuette copies on a smaller scale one of the most famous Greek statues ever made. About 350 B.C. the Greek sculptor Praxiteles carved a cult statue of the goddessAphrodite, the first full-scale female nude in Greek art. Praxiteles' statue became extremely popular, especially in theHellenisticand Roman periods, capturing the attention of both writers and artists. Although the original statue does not survive, its popularity led to a huge production of copies and variations on the theme, so that today more nude Aphrodites survive than any other single ancient statue type.The idea of the goddess caught in a private moment follows a certain voyeuristic tradition in Hellenistic art, and part of the statue's appeal was clearly erotic. The gesture of the goddess's right hand is ambiguous, drawing attention to her pubis and concealing it at the same time. Roman writers such asPlinydid not hesitate to point out the overtly sexual reaction that Praxiteles' statue produced in viewers.",

Several of his other costume designs include elaborately decorated helmets such as the one this centaur wears. Primaticcio probably depicted only one element in a larger composition celebrating the popular story of the neighboring tribes of the centaurs and the Lapiths. According to classical mythology, the Lapiths invited the centaurs to their king's wedding, but the centaurs responded by carrying off the Lapith women-even the bride-under the influence of wine.

Primaticcio may have intended to emphasize only the main lines of the design, for he barely noted the figures' interior modeling: short, expressive pen lines suffice, combined with subtle shadows and highlights.Primaticcio made this drawing as a preparatory study for the Ulysses Gallery at Fontainebleau, which he designed and Nicol\u00f2 dell'Abate and others executed. The Ulysses Gallery was entirely destroyed in 1739, and knowledge of it today depends on such preparatory drawings, copies, and written descriptions. Vulcan sat in one of the corners of the ceiling's second bay, making armor for Ulysses.

This red-figure cup may be the first preserved example of a cup with a figuralfriezeon the outside instead of an eye-cup scheme, as in the Brygos Painter'sWine Cup with the Suicide of Ajax.On both on the interior and the exterior of the cup, Psiax painted erotically charged encounters between youths and men, and males and females. What makes this vase different is that he used incision and added-white in hisred-figure techniqueas well as added-red colors. On this cup, these techniques are joined by an extensive use of added-clayrelief. Thus, the lyre on side A has arms and a cross-piece painted in added color, much of which has flaked off, incised strings, and a raised sound box added in clay (now chipped). The leftmost youth sits on a camp stool which the artist added in clay relief. It has white hinges and is topped by what was once a red cushion. The surface of what was once apparently a brightly colored vase, perhaps enhanced withgilding, is now the beige color of the clay.",

The mastos was a relatively rare cup shape produced by Athenian potters only in the later 500s B.C. The shape fit in with the erotic pleasures of the symposium. Although the nipple on this mastos has been reconstructed, the potter would originally have put a pellet or bead into the nipple so that it rattled as the cup was being used, providing further entertainment.",

In the myth, Hephaistos, the craftsman god, believing that the goddess Athena was attracted to him, attempted to have sex with her. When she resisted, some ofHephaistos'ssemen fell on her leg. She wiped it off with a piece of wool and threw it away, accidentally impregnating Ge, the earth. Athena cared for the resulting infant and kept him in a sacred basket on the Athenian Akropolis.

The unconventional portrait likeness combines a delicate pencil rendering of the sitter's face, the tan paper ground serving as her \"skin,\" with thickly applied red and blue pastel for her clothing. The muted blues of her jacket seem to bleed into the adjacent flowers, bridging sitter and surroundings. Reflecting Redon's fascination with underwater life, these prevalent blues, alongside notes of green and purple, also conjure up an aquatic world with its hidden depths and elusive meanings.",

The additional \"brush\" or image-making tool provided by photography to painters was evident from the beginnings of the medium.

Although photographs never managed to signal the death of painting as initially predicted, they did frequently assume the function that drawing had traditionally held in relation to painting.Compositionally, this is an unusual photograph. Rejlander employs anarrativedevicefrom painting: the use of figures, or parts of figures, asallegoricalrepresentations for ideas. A very young child represents the infant medium of photography. The Painter appears only as a hand extending into the frame at the upper left, although the traditional arts are also represented by the sculpture reproduction in the lower left corner.

Here he conveys a narrative story through dramatic gesture and visual effects. Bewildered, Europa grasps the bull's horn, digs her fingers into his neck, and turns back to look at her companions on the water's edge. One young woman falls to the ground and raises her arms in alarm, dropping the flower garland intended for the bull's neck into her lap, while her friend clasps her hands in consternation and watches helplessly. The carriage driver above rises to his feet and stares at the departing princess in horror. In the background, a city shrouded in mist extends along the horizon, perhaps serving as an allusion to the ancient city of Tyre as well as to contemporary Amsterdam.The dark thicket of trees to the right contrasts with the pink and blue regions of the sea and sky. Sunlight breaks through the clouds and reflects off the water, but the sky behind the trees is dark and foreboding.A master of visual effects, Rembrandt took pleasure in describing the varied textures of sumptuous costumes and glittering gold highlights on the carriage and dresses.",

Even though this view along the Schinckel River is topographically accurate and scholars have identified the house with the tower, it is Rembrandt's economy of means that makes the drawing enchanting.Rembrandt suggested space, light, and atmosphere by relying on blank paper and using a few exquisitely placed accents. A delicate wash over fine, short strokes creates a blurred and luminous effect in the mass of trees. A fine dotting technique further animates this area, giving the sense of a slight breeze passing across the treetops.

Cyrus was momentarily bewildered, but the worried faces of the priests in the background confirm that Daniel has exposed their deception. This story of Daniel's dramatic exposure of the king's idol-worship derives from the apocryphal portion of the Book of Daniel.Light illuminates the figures of Cyrus and Daniel, highlighting their dramatic encounter. Rembrandt contrasted the king's grandeur with Daniel's humility. Facing out and gesturing toward the table, the lavishly attired Cyrus appears large and imposing. By contrast, the youthful Daniel seems small, and his posture suggests modesty or submissiveness before his ruler.

Renoir had spent the previous summer painting outdoors with Claude Monet, who encouraged him to move toward a lighter, more luminouspaletteand to indulge his penchant for luscious, feathery brushwork. Here Renoir retained something of Gustave Courbet's green-and-brown palette while choosing his subject from the sensual, lighthearted garden jaunts of eighteenth-century painters such as Jean-Antoine Watteau and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, whose works he had studied in theLouvre.Unlike the images of seduction created by his predecessors, Renoir's is a fleeting moment caught by chance--middle-class Parisians immersed in nature, possibly a local park, not set before a studio backdrop. The dappled light filtering through the foliage would become a trademark of Renoir's finestImpressionistworks of the 1870s and 1880s. He used a thin, oily paint mix, his glazes here floating into each other to create depth.",

Traditionally, portraits of men were somber, but Renoir combined decorativeness with fidelity to his sitter's appearance. Facial hair was regarded as a powerful indicator of male sexuality, and Renoir shows Cahen d'Anvers's curled mustache echoing the wallpaper's curves, his ruffled red hair referring to the potted plant's feathery leaves. Cahen d'Anvers's authority and status are suggested through his alert, commanding gaze and details such as his elaborate cigarette holder and cravat.Renoir hoped that success in portraiture would lead to success in the wider potential market attracted by the Salon. Twenty years into his career, he had become so disenchanted with Impressionism that he called the movement a \"blind alley.\" He modified his style, combining the loose, painterly effects of early works such asLa Promenadewith Renaissance painting's firm contours and weighty forms. He began receiving portrait commissions, often from wealthy Jewish patrons. Only a year after making this portrait, however, his uncertainty about achieving his aims through portraiture and his increasing anti-Semitism meant that portraiture no longer appeared so promising to him.",

Sebastiano Ricci took this subject from Livy'sHistory of Rome,first published in A.D. 14, but he showed Navius cutting a column, a more aesthetic object.Ricci pared the composition down to its dramatic essentials--two large figures making eloquent gestures--and added a recognizable setting and bystanders to create a sense of community. The slightly shadowed mother and child is a typical Ricci motif. Effectively employing the usual Roman Baroque sense of dramatic light and color, he adopted Giovanni Battista Gaulli's strong, rather hot colors for the costumes and the sky.

Andrea Briosco, called Riccio, made this sculpture while living in Padua, home to a thriving intellectual community and one of the most renowned universities in Europe. The study of ancient Greece and Rome was quite popular at the time, and Riccio combined a refined knowledge of antiquity with the Christian present, much to the delight of his contemporaries. The Virgin's dress and delicate features recall ancient Roman representations of deities. Shells, pearls, a winged putto, and a cameo decorate the crown atop her intricately arranged hair. Displaying the restless nature typical of small children, the infant Christ twists away from his mother to face the viewer.ThoughVirgin and Childwas originally a full-length statue, only the upper half now survives. Because the figures' heads are angled downward, scholars believe that Riccio made the sculpture as the devotional centerpiece of a raised altar. Now largely stripped of color,Virgin and Childwas once vibrantly painted. Originally, both figures had dark brown hair and pale skin. The Virgin wore a blue cloak over a red gown, while the Christ child wore a yellow garment.

Subtlehighlightseven pick up the gleam of the brass studs decorating the chair underneath his left hand. Rigaud achieved these effects by applying a layer of white gouache on top of the black chalk and gray wash, creating a gleaming, three-dimensional effect. In contrast, the man's face and luxuriant flowing wig appear flat and static.Textiles, used for either home furnishings or dress, were important indicators of an individual's social rank in the 1700s. In an age when only the wealthiest members of society could afford such expensive and fragile fabrics as silk, satin, and damask, both quality and quantity mattered. Only wealthy individuals could wear lace in the early 1700s, and fashion strictly controlled the style and the amount that was shown. The abundance of fabulous cloth in this drawing is therefore a silent indicator of this man's wealth and importance.",

        "description": "In ancient mythology, the sphinx embodies an amalgam of human, lion, and hawk body parts. The subject of this watercolor by Auguste Rodin, titled Sphinx, doesn't literally represent such a beast. Instead, the artist drew a young woman, who is standing frontally, with her arms folded.Rodin made this drawing late in his life, during a period of prodigious output. As is common in those drawings, sketchy pentimento lines appear to suggest a figure in motion. Here, though, the scribbly pencil marks may indicate that the model was partially clothed, because of the artist's inscription, \"noir draperie\" (black drapery).Rodin usually sketched his models without taking his eyes off the figure or looking down at the sheet of paper. In this case, the artist first incised the figure's silhouette--notably the hips and elbows--before using the pencil or the brush. Although the figure appears hastily sketched, the drawing as a whole reflects Rodin's considerable abilities as a draftsman. Details, such as the model's perfectly turned right ankle and knee, belie his considerable skills of observation. Carefully applied watercolor washes reveal Rodin's mastery of technique.Like many nineteenth-century artists, Rodin was interested in exotic subjects. Subtle clues, such as sand beneath the woman's feet and a palm tree on the horizon imply that, like the Great Sphinx of Giza, this woman is set in a time-forgotten, romanticized place. Rodin's title implies on a metaphorical level that she--or \"woman\" more generally--is like the sphinx, an enigmatic creature.",

By the 1640s, when Roelant Roghman drew it, this former military building had been converted into a luxurious country house. Signs of its military past are visible in the crenellated roofline, with alternating open spaces from which armed guards could defend the castle and shield themselves.This drawing is typical of Roghman's style in that the primary focus is the castle's architectural presence, while the landscape is secondary. The castle has a monumental quality; its chimney decorations rise to the top of the page. Sharp diagonal lines radiate from the tops of the upper-floor windows, suggesting decorative brick archways above each. Also, the drawing's sharpest details are found in the man-made structures--the castle doorway and the bridge--while the trees nearby and in the distant grove at right appear almost blurred.",

There weren't many miners in those particular areas-the big mines had closed up. If we saw a group perhaps sitting on a porch or the kids wandering around, I would ask them if I could take their picture.-Milton RogovinOver a period of nine years, Milton Rogovin and his wife Anne traveled to Appalachia each summer for working vacations. They visited and documented mining towns and communities. During the 1960s, Appalachia became the focus of international attention for its economic difficulties and the efforts of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to bring relief. Simultaneously, information came to light about the mines' working conditions, from underground fires and explosions to black-lung disease. The Rogovins were well aware of these issues and decided to investigate for themselves.It is easy to notice what is most important to this home's occupants. A few possessions are lovingly arranged: twin frames with portraits of Jesus and Mary, a child's drawing of a bunny, a hinged frame with a woman's portrait and a picture of Jesus. On the table sit a white crocheted tablecloth, a can of tobacco, a Bible, and a record player.

Swirling strokes defining his tousled hair contrast with the parallel lines used to shade the wings.

Three studies of a male nude falling on his back, drawn on the verso of the sheet, provide a clue about this possible undertaking. The verso studies show how Roncalli worked out his composition forThe Conversion of St. Paul, a fresco he executed at a chapel in Rome in 1586. It is possible that the angel was drawn for the same chapel; however, large sections of the painting are now missing due to damage and deterioration.

Similarly, the cornucopia is usually shown facing upward; by depicting it overturned, Rosa expressed reckless extravagance.The beasts, portrayed with stark realism, trample the attributes of art and learning, including books and apalette. Draped in the cardinal red of the Catholic Church, an ass shields an owl, the symbol for wisdom, from the light. Bitter over his exclusion from papal patronage, Rosa included personal references: a book bearing his monogram and a pig stepping on a rose, which alludes to his name.As a satire of Pope Alexander VII's nepotistic artistic patronage, this painting nearly sent Rosa to prison. After showing it privately in his studio, he flagrantly disregarded all advice and exhibited it publicly in the Pantheon in 1659.Allegory of Fortunearoused such a furor that only intervention by the pope's brother saved him.",

This photograph was made in a working-class neighborhood in the Lower East Side in 1938, during the worst year of the Depression.

The woman seated in the doorway beside the candy store, entertained by activity along the street, conveys the sense of dejection that many felt during this time. For generations, local shops in New York City have continued to serve as gathering places for neighborhood residents.Walter Rosenblum made this photograph in the neighborhood where he grew up.

For one would surely marvel at the purple hue of some, the green of others, at those on which the crimson blooms. . . . And so the visitor's mind is lifted up to God. . . .\"In this canon table, which is heavily indebted to Byzantine art, Procopius's aesthetic of colorful variety instilling wonder in the viewer was surely still at work.

The appearance of a western motif such as scrollwork provides evidence of the complexity and richness of resources available to Roslin.

Peter Paul Rubens drew on many Italian models, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, and Michelangelo, for inspiration in depicting the individual apostles. Rubens used a thin, fine line for the monumental figures of the apostles and cross-hatching to convey their solid forms.Theverso, or reverse side of the page, shows several studies of Medea and her slain children. According to Greek legend, Medea, a princess of the foreign kingdom of Colchis, was married to Jason, who eventually left her to marry a native Greek woman. A passionate and jealous woman, Medea stopped at nothing to obtain revenge, including murdering her own children. On the right, long, sweeping lines animate the figure of Medea, whose gaping mouth seems to emit anguished wails. Rubens depicted her striding forward as she roughly carries her children, their bodies limp in death.",

Drawn in luminous light brown ink, the principal figure demonstrates the muscular structure of the back, buttocks, and legs. Fascinated with the structure of the human body, Peter Paul Rubens then drew two subsidiary views of the same powerful form and a detail of the left arm from a different angle.Rubens produced this drawing sometime during an eight-year stay in Italy, and it shows the strong influence of the new approaches he learned there. The skillfully drawn forms show his complex grasp of the human body in three dimensions. The main figure's truncated right arm suggests the artist's study of brokenantiquestatues, while the surging, heroically proportioned forms and the extensive hatching of the musculature display his familiarity with Michelangelo's drawings. Scholars believe that Rubens produced this anatomical drawing in preparation for an instructional book on human anatomy, which he never published. After the artist's death, a printer published an engraving of this drawing in the mid-1600s.",

The ferocious creature--seemingly undaunted by a pair of hounds latched onto its bristled hide--has turned to confront head-on its human adversary. Meleager's blow will prove to be fatal to the boar, but the beast has proven itself as a fearsome foe. Beneath its imposing hooves lie the disemboweled carcass of a hound and the prostrate corpse of the hunter, Ancaeus.The story of the Calydonian boar hunt was told and retold during antiquity--most famously inOvid'sMetamorphoses.When King Oeneus of Calydon failed to honor the goddess Diana with offerings, she released a terrifying boar on his land. The king's son, Meleager, assembled a group of renowned warriors to slay the beast. Several of the huntsmen were killed or maimed before Meleager finally defeated the boar. He presented its head as a trophy to his beloved, the huntress Atalanta, who is seen behind Meleager, with bow in hand.Peter Paul Rubens created this painting a few years after an extended stay in Italy. He drew from ancientsarcophagiand statues he had seen there for the poses of many of the figures. For example, the boar seen in profile was taken directly from a well-known marble in Florence's Uffizi Gallery. Rubens's appropriation of iconic images fromantiquitywas intended to resonate with learned viewers. For the figures on horseback, Rubens borrowed from hisRenaissancepredecessors, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. But Rubens's dynamic and inventive interpretation of the hunt was wholly his own. With this painting, he established the theme of the epic combat between man and animal, a subject to which he would return throughout his career.",

Mary, the mother of Christ, cradles his head and looks heavenward for divine intercession.TheEntombmentwas meant to make the viewer's religious experience personal and encourage the faithful to imagine the physical horror of Christ's Crucifixion. Christ's tortured features confront the viewer, and our attention is focused on his corpse, sacrifice, and suffering. Wounds are openly displayed: blood flows from the gaping laceration in Christ's side and the puncture wounds on his hands. Rubens contrasted the living and the dead by juxtaposing the lifeless body and green-tinged skin of Christ with the healthy complexion of St. John.This painting was probably made to serve as analtarpiecein a small chapel, perhaps one dedicated to the Eucharist. The slab on which the body is placed suggests an altar, while the sheaf of wheat alludes to the bread of the Eucharist, the equivalent of Christ's body in theMass.",

Even in this very finished drawing, he characteristically sacrificed detail to gain a sense of movement and energy.For twenty-five years, Rubens supplied his boyhood friend Balthasar Moretus, head of Antwerp's Plantin Press, with illustrations for books ranging from the philosophy of Seneca to a treatise on optics.

The aged tree was a long-standing theme in Dutch andFlemishlandscape imagery, but in Ruisdael's hands it became a very personal expression.Ruisdael focused thiscompositionaround a hollow tree whose bare limbs reach upward: a heroic element in the landscape. Its lifeless skeleton symbolizes the transience of human life, a favorite Ruisdael theme, and reminds viewers of the suffering and endurance required in life. Yet Ruisdael also set the dead tree amidst healthy ones, showing that both life and death have a share in nature. To balance the scene compositionally, Ruisdael contrasted the dramatic tree with a placid stream and picturesque footbridge on the left.Ruisdael began by sketching the composition in black chalk. He then brushed in a range of tones of gray wash, creating a rich diversity of textural and light effects, especially on the right.Subjects reflecting life's uncertainty and brevity were popular in post-Reformation Holland, where religious painting had nearly disappeared. Thevanitasthemes adopted by Dutch still life painters came from the same urge to record the fleeting character of nature.",

Against the ominous sky, the buildings appear solid and sturdy, and a solitary male figure with his dog seems dwarfed by the natural setting. Sunlight breaks through the heavily clouded sky and settles on the centralmotifof the two half-timber thatched millhouses.When he was in his early twenties, Ruisdael traveled to Germany from his native Haarlem.

The Charles Minot steam engine was thrown from the tracks as the result of an attack by the Confederate cavalry. During the American Civil War, one of the earliest wars to be extensively photographed, much of the Union Army's efforts was directed at rebuilding bridges and railroads destroyed by retreating Confederate forces. This experience working on railroad projects was a great aid to the nation in later years, when countless well-trained Civil War veterans worked on the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. Grenville Dodge, chief engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad and former General in the Union Army, remarked favorably upon the abilities of former soldiers who undertook backbreaking railroad work: \"It was the war that taught them how to think big, how to organize grand projects, how to persevere.\"",

In his hand he casually holds a black hat lined with glowing white satin. Gregory's hat and collar are covered with white powder from his fashionably dressed hair. He is somberly yet richly dressed, alert yet seated at ease. Gregory's decorous pose embodies Russell's ideal of depicting the sitter in a manner appropriate to his age.The portrait's brilliant whites, velvety blacks, and masterful interplay of varied flesh tones with blues are all characteristics of Russell's virtuoso application ofpastel. Russell achieved the even tonality by manually smudging broad, soft areas of crayon onto the paper. He then applied fine, linear flourishes, such as the white highlighting on the cravat and in the hat lining, with a hard, pointed crayon.

In the distance, the delicate bare branches of the trees create black tracery against the pale sky, their round tops echoing the curve of the bridges below and arc of birds overhead.Although Rutgers used both copies and his imagination as sources for his drawings, he drew this quintessential Dutch winter genre scene from life. It is one of two drawings the artist did of the same location on different occasions. Rutgers effectively captures the chill of a winter day with crisp pen work, particularly visible in the architectural details, contrasting against the expanse of white paper and gentle grey and brown washes in the sky and bank of snow.Jisp banned construction of new thatch roofs in 1647 as a precautionary measure. The drawing can therefore be dated before 1664, when a significant fire damaged the city, and likely destroyed any thatched roofs in the city. Close observation also reveals that Rutgers used a slightly different ink to draw the figures on the left than the rest of the drawing, suggesting that he was not satisfied with his original composition and added to it at a later time.",

Although in this drawing he has created a natural-looking scene, many of his drawings are not topographical and he often used interchangeablemotifs. These fantastic, vaguely Central European views reflect the influence of Roelandt Savery's rugged, fictitious mountain landscapes, such as Savery'sLandscape with Waterfall, created about thirty years earlier than Saftleven's drawing.At a time when travel was difficult, landscape drawings and prints gave people both a means and an excuse to conjure up exotic, far-flung lands. More than 1,200 of Saftleven's topographical and imaginary landscape drawings survive, most of which are finished, large-scale drawings made for collectors.",

He leans against a longhoulette,a tool consisting of a narrow metal scoop attached to the end of a pole, which he would use to dig up small clods of earth, throwing them behind him to create a trail for his animals to follow. The oversized, ragged clothes he wears suggest both his youth and his poverty. The billowing folds of the frayed cape, big shoes, and peaked hat envelop the slight frame of the boy, emphasizing the poignant, shy smile on his face. In a mixture of chalk and wash, Herman Saftleven the Younger emphasized the play of sunlight and shadow over the boy's body.In the 1600s, Dutch artists first began to sketch the poor in their works of art, capturing not only their poverty, but also their rustic beauty and dignity. Saftleven sketched this boy, probably hoping to use his image in one of his paintings.",

Inspired by Jean-Antoine Watteau'sf\u00eates galantes,in which elegant people engage in a variety of diversions, often in an idealized park or garden setting, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin devised a similar rural subject.During the 1700s, country dances had become a popular form of summer entertainment for Parisian society. A tireless chronicler of his time, Saint-Aubin surely would have viewed these dances and theatrical performances on the outskirts of Paris. Drawing on the wit and meticulous observation seen in Dutch paintings of peasants in the 1500s and 1600s, Saint-Aubin refined the rustic folk in a characteristically French Rococo treatment.",

The two most prominent sketches--theBirth of Venus, a drawing after a contemporary sculpture in the upper left, and a seated woman reading in the lower right--are joined by two fascinating characters. A black-chalk drawing of a seated writer appears to float between the two larger sketches of theBirth of Venus. A drawing of a young artist at work, executed in pen and ink and red and white chalk, appears in the lower left corner.Saint-Aubin brought together many of his favorite subjects--the artist at work, women reading, and contemporary art--in a lively and engaging way on this sheet. While drawing in his sketchbook, he kept in mind the arrangement of elements, cleverly organizing the subjects so that they correspond to one another. The statue, for example, forms a visual parallel with the reading woman, as both figures look down to the right. Saint-Aubin also added an area of red watercolor on the right side of the sheet, echoing the red-chalk drawing of the artist at work and thereby balancing the composition.",

Rows of oars froth up the sea, the frenzied water foreshadowing the impending combat. Standing at opposite ends of the two central ships are the leaders of warring factions. On one deck is the stoic Roman general Regulus, commanding his followers as they attempt to board an enemy ship. Opposing Regulus is the Carthaginian leader Hamilcar Barca, father of the famed general Hannibal. In fanciful reference to Hannibal, the Carthaginian prows are elephant heads armed with imposing ramming tusks.Gabriel Jacques de Saint-Aubin meticulously described every detail of the foreground ships. He first drew the composition in black chalk and then used pen and ink to further articulate details of the ships, such as their masts and riggings, and the myriad figures. Using a limited palette of deftly applied watercolor--gray, brown, and blue--Saint-Aubin sensitively colored the sea and sky.The first Punic War (264-241 BC) was a conflict largely fought at sea. Involving over three hundred vessels, the battle depicted here was one of the largest navel battles in history. The smaller Roman fleet defeated the Carthaginian by dividing their forces into four squadrons and waging four separate battles.This drawing is one of a series of illustrations Saint-Aubin made in the 1760s for an ambitious history of Rome. Engravings after drawings as well as maps were to accompany this multi-volume series which was never completed. In 1789, twenty-nine engraved plates from Saint-Aubin's drawings illustrated a more modest Roman history.",

The emergence of a white-collar workforce in Germany during the 1920s vastly expanded opportunities for such new types of salaried employees as the bookkeeper, the bureaucrat, the secretary. Although rising employment rates were a positive development, Germany's volatile financial market during this period often meant that jobs were insecure.August Sander intended this image of a stern bank clerk to be part of his portfolio entitled \"The Official.\" The monumental cash register and the note in his hand inform the viewer of this man's monotonous role.

Sander also made many portraits of workers in his studio, without the tools of their trade to act as props or visual clues to their profession.The original image was not so tightly arranged. Sander isolated and enlarged this detail from the original composition.

Nor is it surprising to learn that music was vital in the Sander household. All of the children were given extensive musical training. His eldest son and daughter played the guitar, while his youngest son was an accomplished cellist. Sander often played for friends in the Cologne art circle, who would come over in the evenings to enjoy his homemade rhubarb wine.This self-portrait also depicts Sander's library. Though not formally educated, he read voraciously, and was especially interested in the works of Goethe, Schiller, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, as well as Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann.

The feminine manner in which he holds his cigarette and crosses his legs breaks all traditional rules of masculinity. August Sander's portrait of the artist he called a bohemian suggests that gender roles in Weimar society may have been far more fluid and complex than even he imagined.August Sander was a close friend to many of the young artists in Cologne, frequently showing his photographs in their exhibitions, or trading his images for their paintings. Indeed, Brockmann lived with Sander's family for almost two years, during which time they had numerous discussions about the political, social, and aesthetic concerns of the day.",

The figure of Venus is a study in contrasts: her elaborate hairstyle contrasts with her smooth flesh, and the detachment with which she takes away Cupid's arrow, now missing, disguises her passionate nature. Scenes like this one, drawn from Greek and Roman mythology, were popular in the 1600s and 1700s in France. By representing classical subjects, patrons and artists could justify depictions of the female nude and titillating images of amorous activity. Unusual holes left from the casting process in the top of Venus's head, in her right hand, and on the bottom of her feet may have been used to remove the core material.

His horse stops just before a blind man being led by a dog. The man's closed eyes are an unmistakable clue of his blindness, yet the na\u00efve Josaphat still raises his hand in a gesture of greeting. A lame man appears in theforeground, lifting a cup for alms. In the upper right-hand corner, a man is hanged in the gallows while another is tortured on the wheel.This scene portrays a pivotal moment in the story of Josaphat. As in the story of Prince Siddhartha (later known as the Buddha), the young privileged prince had wished to venture out from the confines of the palace. Unable to deny his son's request, King Avenir instructed a group of escorts to accompany Josaphat abroad and to protect him from the sight of the harsh realities of life, a Herculean task that proved to be impossible. The sight of illness and death--and the realization that these conditions were inevitable for all humans--shattered Josaphat's worldview.",

It belongs to a group of four Andachtsbilder, or devotional paintings, created near the end of his life. In his engravings Schongauer already had explored the theme of theMadonna and Childreading a book in a niche, symbolizing the Virgin's role as Christ's tutor. Here he balanced the Madonna's serenity with the livelyChristChild and the book's fluttering pages. Her dignified face, with its polished modeling and delicate features, is typical of Schongauer, who was heavily influenced byFlemishpainter Rogier van der Weyden's art. Mary's cascade of gently flowing hair shows Schongauer's sensitivity to the expressive potential of line. His attention to detail is especially evident in the thin gold seams in Mary's cloak, the jeweled crown, and the figures' fine facial features. In thebackground, an angel holds the crown and scepter. Since the 1500s, Schongauer has been credited with bringing the advances of NetherlandishRenaissanceart to Germany. He was the main inspiration for Germany's next generation of artists, notably Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Schongauer's engravings had far-reaching impact, influencing Italian artists such as Michelangelo.",

In Italy he learned the elements of Italian Renaissance approach to landscape painting, an idealized vision of Roman antiquity where shepherds tended flocks in serene, hilly terrain.

The thicker lines around its tail and belly suggest the softer furry tufts. Scorza probably drew the animals from life, closely observing their positions and expressions. Scorza drew at least four versions of this wolf, both with and without the doves. Both strong draftsmanship and a direct, unsentimental attitude distinguish this drawing. The clarity of the lines and simple, linear forms suggest that the drawing could easily have been engraved, but scholars have not discovered such an engraving.

Here, he filled almost the entire sheet with Madame Seurat's face. Her downcast eyes create an aura of modesty, and suggest that she is involved in a quiet activity such as reading or embroidery. She is plain, though not severe, with pulled back bun and slightly thick features--an unassuming motherly personage, apparently unaware that she is being observed. The drawing possesses an almost mystical aura, combining extreme intimacy and proximity with the equally extreme interiority of the sitter's facial expression. Her puzzling physical presence and psychological stillness is made all the more vaporous and ghostly by the drawing technique Seurat called \"irradiation,\" which avoided distinct lines and represented the subtleties of light and shadow through tones of black crayon.The drawing was surely full of meaning for mother and son. Even after Georges Seurat moved to his own quarters in 1880, he dined with his mother almost every night. Their close relationship and frequent contact meant that he did not need to look far for a subject with whom he was intimately acquainted. Seurat gave this drawing to his mother.",

The veil of her brimmed hat conceals her face, but her slender figure and erect posture convey that she is a refined young woman--an impression sustained by the fashionable fur-trimmed coat that envelops her.Georges Seurat drew this elegant profile as a series of geometric volumes animated by the play of light and shade. Rather than drawing individual lines, he rubbed roughly textured paper with greasy Cont\u00e9 crayon, creating a large shadowy mass. By combining various densities of crayon--darker for the figure, light and feathery for the background--Seurat explored a concept he called \"irradiation.\" According to his theory, light and dark tones mutually enhance each other as they come together. The glowing halo surrounding the poised figure exemplifies this theory.",

Silvy has done. The Vall\u00e9e de l'Huisne...[is a] true picture in which one does not know whether to admire more the profound sentiment of the composition or the perfection of the details.\"Early collodion-on-glass negatives, such as those Silvy used to render this scene, were particularly sensitive to blue light, making them unsuitable for simultaneously capturing definition in land and sky. Silvy achieved this combination of richly defined clouds and terrain by skillfully wedding two exposures and disguising any evidence of his intervention with delicate drawing and brushwork on the combination negative. The print exemplifies the tension between reality and artifice that is an integral part of the art of photography.The Huisne River provided power for flour and tanning mills and was significant in the history of Nogent-le-Rotrou, the town where Silvy was born. This photograph was taken from the Pont de Bois, a bridge over the river, looking toward the south and downstream. It was only a few minutes' walk from Silvy's birthplace. As the reviewer suggested, it is a sentimental image, an idyllic landscape full of reverence for and memory of a timeless place that was significant in the artist's development.",

In contrast, the soldier on the right glares back at him ferociously, seemingly determined to add to Christ's burden by pressing down on the cross. Sodoma focused on these facial expressions to emphasize the peace of God, even amidst suffering.Sodoma used a highly elaborate technique to draw this scene, with considerable white heightening to create painterly effects for both the faces and the garments of the figures. He drew the Resurrection on the verso in a more calm, classical manner with a more linear technique. Brush and brown ink delineate Christ's muscular body as he emerges from the edge of the tomb with one foot still inside. Cross-hatching and white heightening build up the folds of drapery that flow around him. Sodoma made this study in preparation for a 1535 fresco of theResurrectionin a public building in Siena.",

Her hair blows behind her, indicating sudden movement. The sharp angles of her eyebrows and nose express anxiety, while the diagonal of her body expresses the repulsion she feels towards the growling beast.Andromeda and the Sea Monsterdepicts a dramatic moment from the ancient Greek author Euripides' tale of Andromeda and Perseus. Andromeda's mother angered the gods with her boast that Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids, the attendants of the god of the sea, Poseidon. To appease the offended Poseidon, who threatened to destroy their entire kingdom, Andromeda's parents sacrificed their daughter by leaving her where she would be devoured by his monster. As Andromeda awaits the monster, chained to a rock, Perseus flies overhead, falls instantly in love with her, and rescues her by slaying the beast. Massimiliano Soldani Benzi's interpretation of the story is unusual because he focused on Andromeda's horror at the monster instead of on her rescue.",

The swath of drapery trapped between Leda's thighs, as well as her movement drawing the swan down towards her, hint at the inevitable moment of union.This tale of seduction, mentioned inOvid'sMetamorphoses, was a popular subject for artists from theRenaissanceonwards. An unusual aspect of this version, however, is that Castor and Pollux, the fruit of the union, are not shown. Instead, the artist includedCupid, the god of love. Perched on his wings, Cupid encourages the amorous Jupiter.The contrasting textures of Leda's smooth voluptuous skin and the swan's feathers hint at Massimiliano Soldani Benzi's technical virtuosity with bronze casting.

Roman emperors revered individual gods, and Augustus's patron god was Apollo. Augustus believed Apollo secured victory for his forces in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C: Solon carved other images of Augustus and members of the Imperial family in the guise of deities.Look closely and you will notice that the image is carved into the gem--a technique known asintaglio--to create a sense of depth.

The shadows of the thin columns against the walls create a pattern reflected in the water, whose liquidity is remarkable, given the thick gestural paint that Sorolla applied.The thirty-five-acre Alhambra, built between 1238 and 1358, was the last Moslem stronghold in Western Europe in the late Middle Ages. The Moorish architectural style reached its ultimate refinement here, an airy fantasy that almost seems to float, despite its solid construction of stone and stucco.",

The colored reflections of the light animate the scene and help to define the forms, creating a sense that nature is ever-changing.Sorolla originally chose this frame, made by the firm of Jos\u00e9 Cano, which still exists in Madrid, for the picture.

He had returned to Seville in 1910 to create a second series of paintings, four paintings of townscapes and garden scenes, following the series he had painted in 1908. While he retained the brilliance and atmosphere of his earlier paintings, he seems to have approached this second series in a less fanciful manner.J. Paul Getty had originally determined to collect art only in certain areas, but at the 1933 auction of the Thomas Fortune Ryan collection he bought ten Sorollas, one of his few spontaneous purchases. He later wrote of that moment: \"I was struck by the remarkable quality of Sorolla's paintings, being especially fascinated by his unique treatment of sunlight. . . . Although the purchase of theseImpressionistworks was a major digression from my usual fivefold collecting path, my opinion regarding their beauty, appeal and artistic merit remains the same as it was when I first saw the canvases.\"",

Perhaps he is looking in the direction of another figure, because this sculpture was intended to be one of a pair.The sculpture's companion piece,Lady Feeding a Sheep with Hay, features a shepherdess leaning on a gate feeding a pet lamb. As was customary in porcelain figure production, the two are based on an engraving-Shepherd and Shepherdess by Angelica Kauffmann.Shepherd with His Dogmay also be inspired by a famous sixteenth-century Roman statue,Antinous, of a youthful-looking male in the same pose.This elegant fourteen-inch sculpture made of white biscuit porcelain was produced at the Derby Porcelain Factory in England. (Biscuit is a type of unglazed porcelain admired for its marble-like appearance.)Shepherd with His Dogis thought to have been modeled by the highly talented but little-known Swiss porcelain artist Johann Jakob Wilhelm Sp\u00e4ngler. The sculpture was originally attributed to two of Sp\u00e4ngler's contemporaries, but scholars now believe it to be Sp\u00e4ngler's work due to its refined style, graceful lines, and crisp detail.",

His bold, fractured hatching lends a powerful sculptural quality to the hands. In the face, his strong linework, working together with the luminosity of the white of the paper, produces a powerful, forthright expression.

Deeply set eye sockets, encircled by wrinkles, also draw attention to Belisarius's blindness. His veined and wrinkled forehead, tilted head, and open mouth, emphasize his vulnerable state.In the mid-1700s, a novel by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Marmontel revived interest in Belisarius--a popular general of theRoman Empirewhose promising career was sabotaged by the jealous Emperor Justinian I. In Marmontel's novel, the emperor has the heroic general blinded, reducing Belisarius to begging. He is eventually rediscovered and aided by former officers and his family. This dramatic tale of patriotism, injustice, and redemption was widely embraced in revolutionary and post-revolutionary France and was a popular subject for painters and sculptors--including Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Antoine Houdon, and Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard (whose paintingBelisariusis also in the Museum's collection).Jean-Baptiste Stouf exhibited this marble sculpture at theSalonof 1791; he had previously shown aterracottamodel of thebustof Belisarius in 1785. Like many eighteenth-century artists who depicted Belisarius, Stouf emphasized the subject's pathos, highlighting the injustice of the general's plight. The intimate and sympathetic portrait also demonstrates Stouf's mastery of marble carving. The luxuriantly sculpted beard and cascading curls of hair, the crumpled, crinkled skin, and the broad, high brow are all captured with a subtlety that belies the challenge of carving stone. The formal characteristics of Belisarius echoclassicalandBaroquesculpture but also anticipate theRomanticsensibility of the 1800s.",

It charged me up.--Walker EvansThe impact of seeing this striking image for the first time is evident in Walker Evans's vivid recollection. At the time, most photographers were choosing \"pretty\" subjects and creating fanciful atmospheric effects in the style of theImpressionists. Paul Strand's unconventional subject and direct approach challenged assumptions about the medium.At once depicting misery and endurance, struggle and degradation, Strand's portrait of a blind woman sets up a complex confrontation. \"The whole concept of blindness,\" as one historian has noted, \"is aimed like a weapon at those whose privilege of sight permits them to experience the picture. . . .\"",

The sculptor, Giovanni Francesco Susini, welded the three nude figures together in an intensely dramaticcomposition. While Paris attempts to carry Helen off, she valiantly struggles against him. Below them a female servant protests. The women twist around the central spiral of Paris's lithe body. Susini arranges the figures as if on a stage; both Paris and Helen turn their faces toward the front. Yet, the spiral composition also encourages the viewer to walk around the piece, offering interesting alternate perspectives.

Brown ink defines the figures' often-elongated forms over chunky light-gray washes that add some weight to the grounded and floating figures. The ink looks like gold in some areas, contributing an aura of holiness to objects of the Passion presented by the angels.

At 185 feet in height, the Column interfered with the view from the nearby National Gallery and sparked a bitter controversy regarding the physical transformation of the Square. Talbot's image was made from an angle that caused the base of the column to dwarf the buildings in the distance, including the prominent church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Talbot's decision to focus on the base, letting the column itself extend into infinity beyond the image frame, suggests that he thought that the monument was an oversized intrusion.",

As the elegantly dressed woman plays the lute, a man, who may be her instructor, keeps rhythm and time with his hand. The foot warmer in the lower left corner symbolizes love, and the bed suggests an amorous relationship between the man and woman, maybe even seduction.Gerard ter Borch always set a mood, creating a subtle psychological interplay between the people in his intimate paintings. He delighted in meticulously describing and contrasting varied textures: the soft pile of the woman's velvet jacket, distinguished from its plump white fur trim; the shimmer of her pearl-colored satin dress; the dog's soft, wavy fur; and the variations of wood grain in the cello, furniture, and floor. He noticed even the most minute details, such as the nails in the floorboards and the brass door handle. Ter Borch created about eleven paintings of female lute players, often repeating themotifsof the woman in the satin gown and fur-trimmed jacket, the dog, the foot warmer, the four-poster bed in the background, and the partially opened door.",

Frank Lloyd Wright was not first of all an architect, he was first of all a poet, expressing himself in terms of architecture, and so a building becomes a poetic statement.--Edmund TeskeIn 1936, Edmund Teske spent several weeks at architect Frank Lloyd Wright's living quarters at Taliesin North in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Teske was there to photograph the architect, Taliesin's buildings and grounds, and Wright's apprentices. The creative atmosphere that Teske encountered there made a profound impression on him that lasted throughout his life.For more than three decades beginning in 1940, Teske spent time working on this montage, which represents Wright's achievements. Teske layered and tore his prints and re-photographed them. Wright's portrait and his famous building Fallingwater form the central focus of the montage, overlapping floor plans of architectural studios and images of Taliesin West and North. The seated woman in the lower right is Wright's third wife, Olgivanna. Wright himself floats above a landscape of dilapidated looking traditional architecture and images of ordinary Americans whom Teske saw as symbolic of society.This collage reflects Teske's internalization of the architect's philosophy. Wright had rejected the ornate style of traditional architecture in favor of sleek, simple lines and natural materials. His organic style emphasized the spiritual and symbiotic ties between nature and architecture. Teske assimilated those concepts and combined them with an interest in Vedantic Hinduism, which teaches that time is fluid and cyclical. Teske's homage to Wright suggests his belief in the interconnection of life experiences.",

What is most noticeable is the pattern of elongated holes that puncture the strip in intervals. These punched holes are obviously manmade; they appear too regularly spaced and square-shaped to be caused by the branches that the paper is snagged on.This image was part of a series of studies that Teske made of his hometown, Chicago, in which he documented the rundown industrial environment on the city's South Side during the late 1930s. This strip of paper once had a purpose: It generated music from a pianola, or player piano, whose keys performed the notes coded as holes in the paper. Now discarded, it could be imagined that a wind gusting across the prairie might cause a soft whistling sound as it passes through the holes. Although the strip of paper no longer performs the music it was meant to play, by photographing it Teske suggested that even in its rumpled state, it is still worth looking at.",

To emphasize the deteriorated state of this kitchen sieve, Edmund Teske combined several experimental darkroom techniques to make this one-of-a-kind print.Teske employed solarization-a process by which some black and white tones are reversed by exposure to light during the development process-and chemical staining, in which the exposed print is alternately developed and exposed to light. The solarization enhances the sieve's unique patterning as well as the blocks of light that draw attention to its form and the blades of grass poking through its eroded bottom. The print's chemical stains and streaks, ranging from reddish-browns to vivid blues, create streaks and colors that evoke the rusting and cracking of the sieve.Teske made this negative in Chicago in 1939 and returned to it many years later to make the print. He did not use traditional toners in his photography. Instead he devised his own duotone solarization technique in the late 1950s, which he applied here. For him, this style of darkroom manipulation resulted in a more organic look in keeping with his philosophy of life. Through his study of Vedantic Hinduism and the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright, Teske felt a strong connection to nature. By choosing a decaying object as his subject and by reworking an old negative, Teske underscored his belief in the cyclical nature of time; that life-forms go through periods of disintegration and rebirth.",

Mrs. Soakup gave music lessons and operated the studio, which was built next to the Soakup's suburban Chicago home. Teske was probably drawn to these objects because music was one of his passions: He took saxophone lessons and learned to play the piano in his youth.This image also reflects Teske's more prosaic documentary approach during a period in which he aimed to make a \"portrait\" of his hometown. Teske was always drawn to subjects that were more personal to him, especially the environments of people he felt close to. This photograph has an intimate, candid feel to it because of its composition, in which the selection of carefully arranged objects are thrown slightly off-balance by the randomly stacked books and papers to the left.

Richard was out, I was in and Richard was under.

The image reflects Teske's outlook on human identity, particularly his own fluid approach to sexuality and the idea that a person can embody both masculine and feminine qualities.Soft light draws attention to the youth's curly hair and lithe body, which form a visual contrast to the man's work he is engaged in: repairing a car and getting dirty. For Teske, the male body was as worthy of idealization as the female nude. Soakup is portrayed in a candid way that evokes his sexuality and their intimacy.After moving from Chicago-where this picture was made-to Los Angeles, Teske studied a branch of Eastern philosophy, Vedantic Hinduism, that supported his progressive outlook on human identity. In addition, it taught Teske to believe in fate and chance. Years later, he liked to point out that in this photograph the first four numbers on the car's license plate, 1652, were the same as his Los Angeles street address on Harvard Boulevard.",

He is surrounded by an imagined metaphysical event evoking Biblical descriptions of the Apocalypse. Horsemen symbolizing divine wrath trample everything beneath them, as angels blow trumpets to unleash natural disasters.To make this composite print, Edmund Teske combined two negatives-the portrait of his friend and a copy of a Gustave Dor\u00e9 engraving illustrating the work of Anger's favorite poet, John Milton. In the epic poem,Paradise Lost, the fallen angel Satan wages war on heaven. This image illustrates a section called \"Pandaemonium,\" literally meaning \"all demons\" or hell.Teske made this photograph after years of experimentation with various forms of darkroom manipulation. It exemplifies his later style but also suggests Anger's multilayered, \"psychedelic\" approach to filmmaking. Anger became known for his experimental, homoerotic films,Fireworks,Eaux d'artifice,andScorpio Rising. An Anger film that Teske collaborated on,Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome, covered a similar subject, Dante'sInferno.",

The woman's visage is set against \"masculine\" elements such as the building's rough exterior, and in the distance, a smokestack and electrical tower. Hanging clothes soften this stark industrial world, and the woman's closed eyes and thoughtful expression set a contemplative mood.Teske photographed the landscape in 1940 in a steel industry shantytown on the outskirts of Chicago. The image is sandwiched with a 1956 negative portraying Shirley Berman, the wife of Wallace Berman, a Beat movement artist and poet. Both were friends of Teske in Los Angeles; he often used Shirley's portrait in composite pictures as an archetypal female figure.For Teske, printing old negatives had a nostalgic and symbolic function. The composite photograph created a timeless, if not idealized, world that would otherwise be out of reach with a more conventional photographic approach. This composite image hints at a psychological state: the realm of the imagination.",

There is enough light to identify his facial features, but much of his form fuses with the room's shadows. The doorway of blinding light obscures any sense of what is outside. Instead, light and dark function symbolically to create a timeless, spiritual world.The slim figure in this nude study is artist George Herms, who was a prominent Los Angeles Beat movement artist and a good friend of Edmund Teske. He seems aware of being photographed but relaxed and contemplative as he stands in the doorway of his Topanga Canyon studio.Teske and Herms became good friends in the 1960s and shared many ideas about life and art-particularly a fascination for abandoned objects marked by the passage of time. Herms often incorporated discarded items into his sculptural assemblages, while Teske was fond of photographing the same types of subjects. Here, Teske took a similar approach to portraiture as he did to his found-object subjects, aiming to evoke a sense of metaphorical transformation.",

Although it was published on the back of The Doors' 1970 compilation album,13, Edmund Teske did not make this photograph for commercial reasons. In the late 1960s he became acquainted with Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors. He was drawn to the musician's blend of feminine and masculine attributes and made several portraits of him.Teske made this photograph of Morrison and The Doors in a garage at the back of his Hollywood studio. The other band members-Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore-are gathered next to Morrison and surround a rather totemic-looking bust of Ludwig van Beethoven on a table.While this is a fairly typical-looking band portrait, Teske made it seem far less conventional by superimposing another image with it. The second picture is a close-up of an old and cracked vinyl seat cushion. Teske's vertical framing emphasizes the cushion's swirling texture, which fills the empty space above the bandmembers' heads. This patterning creates a psychological dimension that complements the subjects' thoughtful expressions.",

A comic character in Italian theater, his humpback, hooked nose, and stupidity made him the focus of much humor in thecommedia dell'arteand other popular entertainments. Other characters, also wearing masks, stand around watching the scene, preparing a chair for the weary Punchinello and fetching an umbrella.Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo produced this drawing as part of a series of 103 works dealing with specific episodes in the life of Punchinello, entitledDivertimento per li ragazzi(Diversions for Children). The scenes, whose themes range from amusement to tragedy, illuminate the complex character of the hunchbacked fool. As a testament to Tiepolo's fondness for this subject, he decorated his family home, Villa Ziani, with images from the series.Tiepolo sketched the drawing first in black chalk, which was easy to change, before drawing in the figures with pen, ink, and brown wash. The numerous black chalk lines that still remain suggest that the artist made several changes to the design before he settled on this scene.",

The bed would have been placed sideways against a wall, with a draped baldachin, now missing, above. The large wheels allowed servants to pull out the body of the bed easily, leaving the tall back attached to the wall while they made it up. It was probably set into an alcove or niche in the bedroom wall.In eighteenth-century France, a bed of this shape was called alit \u00e0 la turque(Turkish bed) because of its two scrolling ends. This title does not refer to any specific Turkish design source but reflects the eighteenth-century preoccupation with anything exotic and unusual from foreign countries. Turkey, China, and Egypt were among the places that inspired craftsmen in their creation ofromanticand luxurious interiors. The intention was not to accurately recreate foreign objects but to impart a feeling of exotic opulence, even if only through the name attached to an object. The fashion for things \"Turkish\" peaked in the middle of the 1700s, whenMadame de Pompadourhad a bedroom that was known as thechambre \u00e0 laturque(Turkish bedroom) only because the paintings displayed in the room showed a slave girl presenting a cup of tea to a sultaness.",

Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessels shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes. This change was due to the fragile nature of the white slip, which did not wear well but served the one-time usage of a funeral quite nicely.",

Dressed in armor with a diminutive page looking up to him, Alfonso d'Avalos exudes the tremendous power he wielded as governor of Milan and commander general of imperial forces in Italy under the Holy Roman Emperor,Charles V. As the Abbot of Brant\u00f4me--a French historian--observed, Avalos was a man who took great care with his appearance. He was born into an illustrious Spanish-Neapolitan family and trained for a military career under his cousin, Ferdinando Francesco, the Marchese di Pescara. After winning numerous military campaigns, Avalos was honored with theOrder of the Golden Fleece. He is shown wearing the Order's royal collar over an elaborate and beautifully wrought suit of armor befitting an imperial leader. In the lower left, his page hands him a helmet. Titian, who may have known Avalos personally, endowed him with all the earnestness of a learned and contemplative man, while at the same time conveying his authority.Titian, along with Raphael, set the standard for court portraiture during the subsequent development of Western painting. This portrait heralds such remarkable later paintings as Anthony van Dyck'sPortrait of Agostino Pallavicini,Domenico Fetti'sPortrait of a Man with a Sheet of Music,and Guercino'sPopeGregory XV.",

The blue served as a middle tone, with the shadows and outlines drawn in black chalk and the rippling back muscles highlighted in white. Just as in his characteristically textural paintings, Titian combined the three colors to fully model a three-dimensional figure. The smudgy, roughly applied black chalk accentuates the impression of the varied play of light over a sculptural form.

This Getty painting is unique because it is the only composition that shows the Magdalene'sBibleresting on a cloth-covered support rather than a skull--a symbol used to invite contemplation of death.Images of Mary Magdalene, the fallen woman whomJesusfound worthy to redeem and who would spend the rest of her life in solitude to atone for her sins, were especially prevalent during the Counter-Reformation, a period of devout Catholicism that lasted from approximately 1540 to 1640. Upon seeing Titian's conception of Mary Magdalene, the art historian Vasari declared that the picture \"profoundly stirs the emotions of all who look at it; and, moreover, although the figure Mary Magdalene is extremely lovely it moves one to thoughts of pity rather than desire.\"",

Cupid sleeps in the background, a symbol of Adonis's resistance to Venus's entreaties, since his ineffective arrows hang uselessly in a tree. The story ends tragically; during the hunt the mortal Adonis is fatally gored by a wild boar.Titian's loose, energetic strokes of paint give the painting a sense of spontaneity and movement. In some areas, the artist even painted with his finger, as seen in Adonis's arm. The composition's dynamism springs from the torsion caused by Venus's awkward pose, which was inspired by an ancient sculptural relief.

Carefully and economically placed hatchings capture the goat's shimmering fur. Titian even created air with line, as in the atmosphere that envelops the distant city.The subject is enigmatic, though it may relate to the erotic mythologies that Titian was painting for King Philip II of Spain at about the same time. The underlying theme may be Idleness or Indolence, represented by the two shepherds lounging in the shade with their flock of sheep.

Drawn from memories culled over many years of attendance at this popular entertainment, these works reveal his acute observation of horses, dogs, acrobats, clowns, and bareback riders. In this image, a performer still wearing her slippers follows a lumpy horse into the arena to perform for the spectators in the stands.

He added highlights to enrich the texture and atmosphere, blotting the wash to reveal the white of the paper in the lighthouse and scratching directly into the paper to render the flecks of light in the waves crashing over the boat. With these bold techniques, Turner came close to modern abstraction in his efforts to expand the expressive and stylistic range of landscape painting.He made this watercolor for a series of engravings entitledPicturesque Views in England and Wales, published between 1827 and 1838.",

Tones of brown paint near the bottom of the canvas give a sense of the sea's violent power.On the foredeck of a ship that strains against the waves, a man stands in a white uniform and waves with confidence. While scholars are uncertain of the exact historical event Turner described, one probable interpretation is that the man depicted here is Dutch naval officer Cornelis Van Tromp, who was dismissed from naval service in 1666 after failing to follow orders. Van Tromp was reinstated in service and reconciled with his navy superiors in 1673.

With a potted fern and dried leaf on the ledge in front, Ulmann created a kind of occupational portrait, carefully framing the herbalist between the columns of a porch. The woman leans casually and extends a rather large, strong, and masculine-looking hand and forearm forward toward unidentifiable objects on the ledge. With her close-fitting, torn work shirt and wiry, slender build, she is an ambiguous figure, androgynous and possibly of mixed race.",

Barefoot and clad in drab robes, Heraclius has abandoned his fine clothing in order to pass through the gate of Jerusalem with humility. Standing beside Heraclius and clad in a bishop's mitre and white robe is the patriarch of Constantinople, Zachariah. Around this central pair, several spectators have dropped to their knees at the sight of the cross.In 628 A.D., having recovered the true cross from the Persians, Heraclius appeared at the gate of Jerusalem intending to enter in triumph. But as he and his followers approached the gate, stones fell from the walls, blocking his passage. An angel appeared and told him that in his opulent clothes, he could not enter through the same gate that Christ had humbly entered riding on a donkey. The message of this story is clear: the kingdom of heaven is open only to those who have forsaken the riches of the material world.The Exaltation of the Cross, in the form of a narrative series, appeared in several early Renaissance frescoes. But it is a subject rarely represented in painting. Juan de Vald\u00e9s Leal frequently used painted sketches to work out his ideas for large-scale compositions. This oil sketch was created for his last major commission, a monumental fresco to decorate the church of the Hospital de la Caridad in Seville, Spain This preparatory form highlight's Vald\u00e9s Leal's agitated brushwork, thick impasto, vivid coloring, and dramatic sense of movement.

By placing Van Balen's right hand on the head of an antique bust while his left presses a soft cloth close to his chest, Van Dyck effectively suggested the erudition and refined personality of his mentor.",

        "description": "Near death after being tied to a tree and shot through with arrows, Saint Sebastian barely notices the angel helping to remove them. Anthony van Dyck painted the subject of Saint Sebastian many times, choosing various moments in the saint's story but never focusing on the one thing that most other artists emphasized: the saint's flesh punctured with arrows. Van Dyck's goal was to explore the subject's emotional possibilities, rather than the physical wounds. In this scene, the naked and defenseless Saint Sebastian is so consumed by suffering that he is practically unaware of the angel's assistance.Using a monochromatic grisaille technique and thin paint, Van Dyck rapidly sketched in his composition, exploring the effect of light and shadow on Christ's torso and the angel's body. He painted this oil sketch in preparation for a painting that was probably never completed or is now lost. It combines the freshness, immediacy, and fluency of a drawing with the monumentality of a large painting. These qualities characterize the Flemish oil sketch, which Peter Paul Rubens first developed as an alternative to drawing and which Van Dyck, his most gifted pupil, soon adopted.",

He probably began by drawing the Scheveningen woman on the verso. Possibly dissatisfied with its murky effect, he may also have cut down the sheet to its current dimensions. Recycling the high-quality Torchon paper, he turned the sheet over and painted this luminous scene in watercolors as he watched the women at work in the field.With the whites blowing from the fence, van Gogh retained the freshness of the moment and created a sense of motion within an otherwise still landscape. Divergent and well-observed details combine into a single overall scheme, conveying a sense of open outdoor space. Masterfully handling a difficult medium, van Gogh revealed the luminosity of watercolor and hinted at the expressiveness and colorful palette of his art to come.",

Van Gogh drew and painted many portraits of Roulin, a postal worker in Arles, where Van Gogh lived from 1888 to 1889. In letters and pictures, Van Gogh idealized Roulin, regarding him as both a man of the people and a sage.Facing frontally, Roulin is pushed close to the picture plane, with his eyes looking slightly wistfully to the side. Van Gogh's energetic lines describe Roulin's full beard, his facial structure, and his somewhat crooked nose. With the dark, thick lines of a reed pen, Van Gogh hatched the vibrating coat and cap. Behind Roulin, a patchwork of nervous, intersecting lines drawn with a quill pen creates an overall surface tension, reinforcing the energy emanating from the sitter and the unsettled nature of his gaze.",

In the center, a man scythes a section of the field while a woman bundles cut wheat under her arm. The background shifts to the cityscape of Arles, where churches and densely packed houses stretch across the horizon. A railroad train and factories churning smoke into the sky signal the dawn of the machine world and its effect on traditional ways of life.This drawing embodies many of the characteristic features of van Gogh's work: remarkably varied graphic strokes, a subject matter that comments on the human condition, a golden glow that suggests the warm light of southern France, and a balanced yet dynamic composition.",

There, in the last year before his death, he created almost 130 paintings. Within the first week, he beganIrises, working from nature in the asylum's garden. The cropped composition, divided into broad areas of vivid color with monumental irises overflowing its borders, was probably influenced by the decorative patterning of Japanese woodblock prints.There are no known drawings for this painting; Van Gogh himself considered it a study. His brother Theo quickly recognized its quality and submitted it to theSalon des Ind\u00e9pendantsin September 1889, writing Vincent of the exhibition: \"[It] strikes the eye from afar. It is a beautiful study full of air and life.\"Each one of Van Gogh's irises is unique. He carefully studied their movements and shapes to create a variety of curved silhouettes bounded by wavy, twisting, and curling lines. The painting's first owner, French art critic Octave Mirbeau, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters, wrote: \"How well he has understood the exquisite nature of flowers!\"",

The artist employed a warm, glowing palette of gold and orange, endowing the figure with a luminous quality appropriate to a holy person.The initial, cut from an antiphonal, probably introduced a generic text devoted to martyrs, which was individualized by the insertion of a particular saint's name. The saint shown is thus not a specific person but a composite martyr accompanied by the attributes of a number of saints who died for the Christian faith.  The wool comb at the figure's feet was an instrument used to torture Saint Blasius, the rocks could refer to the stoning of Saint Stephen, the fire may refer to Saint Lawrence who was roasted alive, and the swords could indicate any number of martyr saints. Finally, the palm frond is a symbol of the martyr's triumph over death in the Christian afterlife.",

In the final painting, the figure's odd gestures are understandable: he tugs on his beard and rests his arm on his sword. Vasari left the crossed leg somewhat indistinct because he knew that a shield would mask the leg in the painting; he may not yet have decided on the pose of the head when he made this drawing. The brief drapery study at the upper right seems to relate to the cloth covering the figure's upper arm in the painting.The painted figure, one of the thirty-nine paintings in Vasari's decorative scheme, occupies a roundel at the west end of a vast coffered ceiling in Florence's Palazzo Vecchio.

This drawing is for the southeast section of the cupola. The pictorial scheme is divided into eight segments in five concentric zones. Vasari arranged the scenes according to a Counter-Reformation formula: At the top, an Elder of the Apocalypse, angels, and helmeted holy figures appear bearing instruments of the Passion. Below that are the Divine Tribune of Saints and an Archangel, flanked by Fortitude and Patience, who greets the saved rising from Purgatory. At the lower right, naked figures condemned for their sins are thrust into the jaws of a demonic beast. Vasari only partially finished the cupola fresco before his death in 1574.

When shown from the side, the bird's plumed ruff, protruding from its breast, appears more pronounced and the long, narrow beak is more noticeable. Van Veen produced the delicatetonaleffect of the feathers by building up layers of watercolor and bodycolor over black chalk.

The depiction of Mary's throne presented a challenge to the artist, but he set it at an angle thus, giving a sense of depth. He used the space above Gabriel by sweeping the angel's wings upwards so that the feathery ends touch the point where the frame meets the panel. The Virgin's facial features, her hieratic pose, and the decorative patterning of her dress and the cloth of honor draping her throne all illustrateByzantineconventions of the past.

Originally, scholars thought the painting was a self-portrait by Paolo Veronese, but no one can confirm this speculation since Veronese's appearance is otherwise completely unknown. Best known for his large decorativefrescocycles, Veronese did not paint many portraits. For him to have taken the time to paint this large, impressive portrait points to the commission's importance.The man leans on the base of a structure with fluted columns. In a niche between the columns is a marble sculpture of a draped female figure, of which only the lower portion is visible. Carvedreliefs, barely discernible, adorn the sides of the architectural base. These clues may refer to the subject's profession, perhaps that of a sculptor or architect. In the background at the lower left is the Venetian basilica of San Marco, placed in an imaginary rural setting. Most likely, the inclusion of San Marco alludes to the sitter's association with the church or the Venetian state.",

Borrowing elements from his teacher Rembrandt van Rijn's 1637 rendition of the subject, Victors set his figures before and within an architectural setting and opened the composition to a clouded landscape on one side. Strong contrasts of light and dark and a foreshortened angel, flying away on a diagonal and viewed from the back, give the scene animation and urgency.

In the 500s B.C., Greek vase-painters frequently placed eyes on vessels, perhaps because they were believed to be apotropaic--that is, they had the power to ward off evil. The other side of the cup has a similar scene with three busts, one male and two female. The center female was once painted white and wears a type of headdress called apolos, typical of Greek goddesses. These busts, however, are harder to identify than those on the front of the cup. Some scholars identify them as Zeus, Hebe, and Hera, suggesting that the subject of the cup as a whole would be the apotheosis of Herakles, his introduction on Mount Olympus as a god. Other scholars, however, interpret the heads as Hades, Persephone, and Demeter and the cup's theme as Herakles' introduction into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a cult that promised a better afterlife to its followers.",

        "description": "In the publicationBill Viola: The Passions,the artist describes the plot of his videoEmergence:Two women are seen sitting on either side of a marble cistern in a small courtyard. They wait patiently in silence, only occasionally acknowledging each other's presence. Time becomes suspended and indeterminate, the purpose and destination of their actions unknown. Their vigil is suddenly interrupted by a premonition. The younger woman abruptly turns and stares at the cistern. She watches in disbelief as a young man's head appears, and then his body rises up, spilling water over the sides and out onto the base and the courtyard floor.The cascading water catches the older woman's attention, and she turns to witness the miraculous event. She stands up, drawn by the young man's rising presence. The younger woman grasps his arm and caresses it as if greeting a lost lover. When the young man's pale body reaches its fullest extension, he totters and falls. The older woman catches him in her arms, and with the help of the younger woman, they struggle to lower him gently to the ground. Lying prone and lifeless, he is covered by a cloth. Cradling his head on her knees, the older woman finally breaks down in tears as the younger woman, overcome with emotion, tenderly embraces his body.As a work of art,Emergencetranscends this--and probablyany--literal description. The video resembles a painting because it is framed, mounted into a wall, silent, and the narrative occurs in extremely slow motion. As a rear-projection installation, it assumes an otherworldly glow. Although the plot suggests biblical stories such as Christ's Resurrection, such metaphorical associations are ambiguous: For example, the man rising out of a fountain of water implies birth, but his body, when laid out on the ground, suggests death.It is the viewer's participation almost as a bystander to a miraculous event, however, that makes the work mesmerizing. During the nearly twelve-minute video, the observer experiences the same extended passage of time as the women waiting by the well. This deliberate slowing down of sensual input encourages a heightened awareness of the characters' every nuanced expression and movement--and in turn, of the viewer's own perceptive process.Emergencewas commissioned by the Getty Museum as part of theBill Viola: The Passionsexhibition organized by the Museum in 2003. The video was inspired by a fresco from the 1400s by Masolino da Panicale, in which the dead Christ is shown at the moment of Resurrection.",

To his left stands Saint John the Evangelist.At the lower right, Saint Bartholomew holds a book and a knife, the symbol of his martyrdom, and an elderly Saint Peter holds the keys to the kingdom of heaven.In the central panel of the upper tier, the Virgin holds the Christ Child, who raises his right arm in blessing. At the top left, Saint Catherine of Alexandria holds a broken wheel, her symbol of martyrdom, and Saint Ursula clasps two rods with banners. On the Virgin's left, Saint Apollonia holds a book and a pincer with a tooth, referring to the instruments of her martyrdom, and Saint Lucy holds an oil lamp that alludes to the significance of her name, saint of light.",

They asked me who my favorite Disney character was and I said, 'Minnie Mouse, because she can get me close to Mickey.'So wrote Andy Warhol in 1981. Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein had painted Mickey Mouse on a challenge from his young son to prove that he could \"draw like the people who did cartoons,\" but this made his friend Andy Warhol jealous. Lichtenstein had \"gotten to Mickey first,\" thus scooping Warhol on representing the popular cultural icon.Lichtenstein and Warhol collected each other's work. As part of a trade between the two artists, Warhol made this Polaroid study in preparation for painting his friend's portrait. He admired Lichtenstein's art, which employed a limited palette of flat primary colors and heavy black outlines in imitation of comic book illustrators and commercial printing methods.",

        "description": "In the late 1970s, Warhol painted portraits of Liza Minnelli based on his Polaroids. Minnelli, a Hollywood child who first appeared onscreen as a toddler, was an important part of Warhol's inner circle in the 1970s and 1980s. She had formidable show-business parents--singer-actress Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli--and achieved her own lead roles in stage productions only after performing with her mother and working as an apprentice on other musicals. In Minnelli Warhol found a powerfully iconic face with strong elements ready-made for the Polaroid. Her short black bangs, large dark eyes outlined with heavy makeup, and full lips painted a dark red stood out in the print even before they were transferred to silkscreen, which would simplify them even further. Warhol finally chose to paint from another print, rather than from this one. Perhaps he felt that the red-orange hooded dress gave the composition a somber, mourning quality unfit for the sitter's home. On the other hand, Warhol must have appreciated the simple lines and religious overtones of Minnelli's draped head and sad gaze. He portrayed her as an alluring celebrity while suggesting her private burdens.",

The bulky apparatus could not easily be moved for compositional changes; it had to remain stationary while the subject was arranged. Then, when all was ready, Polaroid's technician was on hand to operate it. In spite of these restrictions, Warhol seems to have had fun making more than ten portraits--most of them self-portraits.Warhol made four extreme close-up self-portraits with the new camera in a single day, including this one. He seems to have quickly understood that he had to get very close to the enormous camera, to confront it almost, thus making a larger-than-life-size portrait that exploited the camera's unusual potential. He gazed upward and away from the lens, leaving the left side of his face in deep shadow. These elements emphasize and abstract the simple highlighted lines of his face.",

He admired \"the boys who spend their lives trying to be complete girls,\" so in 1981 he and a photographic assistant, Christopher Makos, agreed to collaborate on a session portraying Warhol in drag. In many ways, they modeled the series on Man Ray's 1920s work with the French artist Marcel Duchamp, in which the two artists created a female alter ego name Rrose S\u00e9lavy for Duchamp.Warhol and Makos made a number of pictures, both black-and-white prints and color Polaroids, of their first attempt. For the second round of pictures, they hired a theater makeup person. This stage professional better understood the challenge of transforming a man's face into that of a woman. After the makeup, Warhol tried on curled, straight, long, short, dark, and blonde wigs. Here he appears in a conventionally masculine white shirt and plaid tie.",

He and Warhol met in 1960 and two years later got together at Warhol's studio in a session that provided inspiration for both artists. Rauschenberg discovered the silkscreen process that Warhol was already using to transfer photographic images to canvas, and Warhol decided to do a series of paintings based on family snapshots of Rauschenberg, taking him as his first non-celebrity Pop subject. Through large canvases that repeated his portrait as many as twenty-five times, Warhol made Rauschenberg's face famous.A passion for photographs, including those they made themselves, was at the center of artmaking for both Warhol and Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg's confidence in photographs as major gallery pieces may have reassured Warhol that he should begin exhibiting some of the hundreds of photographs he had made in documenting his own life.",

Warhol made this portrait in the fall of 1982, when he was first formally introduced to the newly famous twenty-one-year-old painter. Warhol was one of Basquiat's heroes; the young star, in turn, represented for Warhol the creative sexual energy of the 1960s. The two prolific artists carried on an intense friendship in the mid-eighties, culminating in an artistic collaboration. Basquiat died of a drug overdose before he was twenty-eight, fulfilling his belief that \"the true path to creativity is to burn out.\"",

Andy Warhol made Haring's acquaintance in 1982.Haring attributed his simple graphic style, which Warhol praised as \"cartoonist,\" to the hallucinatory power of drugs. Warhol made his Polaroids of Haring, seen here on the left, and his partner Juan Dubose, in preparation for several forty by forty-inch painted portraits, one executed in black and white. The camera's flash and studio lighting created strong shadows that haunt the figures.

After he settled at the Chelsea Hotel, where segments of Warhol's film were shot, he began making photographs, often self-portraits or portraits of his roommate, the poet Patti Smith, and usually with a borrowed Polaroid camera.Mapplethorpe's maturing approach to photography resembled Warhol's in many ways. He had no patience for the technical side of the medium and prided himself on gaining a reputation without ever having made a print himself. Portraiture was his main theme, and he used the camera as a means of making connections with celebrities, potential patrons, and possible lovers. In the 1980s, sales of Mapplethorpe's pictures soared. Warhol was commissioned to paint his portrait, so Mapplethorpe sat for the preparatory Polaroids, including this one. In turn, Warhol sat for Mapplethorpe in 1986.",

Her very fast life had been filled with yachts, discotheques, costly resorts, designer clothes, an early marriage to an older man, and a fairly swift divorce. As the oldest of the prince's three children, she had served as \"first lady\" of Monaco since her mother's tragic death in an automobile accident the previous fall. Andy Warhol portrayed her in the same aloof style that had been her mother's hallmark.Warhol considered royalty another element of the Pop scene. His representations of Princess Caroline, however, were more in the tradition of Hollywood studio photographers than that of court painters. Warhol posed Caroline in profile, as if he were photographing a legendary star, with her long, soft, wavy hair hanging loose on her bare neck. The lighting on her face cast a deep shadow, creating strong chiaroscuro in 1940s film noir style; along with her downward gaze, the lighting made her appear remote and imperious.",

Carleton Watkins photographed this Pullman Palace Sleeping Car shortly after the invention revolutionized rail travel for the American public. Prior to the Pullman car, most rail coaches consisted of little more than rickety wooden boxes with wooden seats or benches, inadequate heating and ventilation systems, and inadequate springs that made for a rough ride. This photograph shows Pullman's elaborately designed coach fitted with his patented folding bed. A carpeted floor, upholstered seats, and black walnut paneling all add to the luxurious interior. In the mirror at the back of the car, Watkins's camera is visible.Pullman's sleeping car was revolutionary for its service as well as its comfort. Courteous employees, efficient baggage handling, and cleanliness made these cars a popular choice for the modestly affluent passenger. Each car was equipped with a hundred sheets and pillowcases, forty blankets, and various towels. The legendary \"Pullman porter\" enforced company policies, such as the rule against wearing boots to bed.",

This example shows his mastery of the technique and of composition.

There is no cover charge nor cigarette girl, and a vending machine dispenses cigarettes. Neither is there a hat check girl. Patrons prefer to dance with their hats and coats on. But there is a lively floor show...the only saloon in the Bowery with a cabaret license.So Weegee described the setting of this spirited photograph, a rousing portrait of two colorful clubgoers, each treating the photographer to a glimpse of healthy gams. The woman on the left displays a stockinged calf, paper money inserted for safekeeping and her foot bulging out of her shiny T-strap pump. The toothy smiles and ribald gestures of the two women are infectious, infusing the image with a good-time charm and personality.",

Weegee often used windows and fences as visual elements to frame and thus draw attention to his subjects. Here, the wagon door's chain-link fencing creates a dominant pattern, brightened by proximity to Weegee's intense flashbulb. The fence seems to isolate Pape's face and hands within diamonds of crisscrossing wire.

During the Crimean War, she followed the troops as a sutler, one of the many people offering hospitality services and running inns, bars, and restaurants. In the Ukraine, in addition to running a hotel, she supplied medical services to British troops on the front line, remaining even longer than her fellow nurse Florence Nightingale. After the war, Seacole published her autobiography,The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands,which became a huge popular and commercial success. By the time Henry Weekes executed this bust in 1859, she was a household name in England.  Emphasizing her innate nobility, Weekes used a simple oval form for the chest, adorning the mature woman with only a necklace and the hoop earrings that she always wore.

Stretched out with her hands tucked under her back, her figure forms a series of arcing and sweeping lines that draws the viewer's eyes from her forehead to her breasts, rib cage, stomach, and thighs. Weston made this image when the sun was high overhead, resulting in a small shadow under the arch of her back. His elevated and diagonal angle exploited the formal qualities of Modotti's curvaceous figure.Modotti was not simply Weston's lover and model; she exerted an enormous influence on his creative vision during their years together in Mexico. She arranged for his first exhibition in Mexico City, introduced him to many prominent artists, served as his language interpreter, and worked as his darkroom assistant.

By focusing on a simple, everyday object, Weston invites viewers to contemplate a subject they might otherwise ignore. As the centerpiece of the photograph, the bench is transformed from a commonplace piece of furniture to a graphic study of rhythmic, horizontal bands. The weathered finish and broken bottom band are telling signs of age; like the discarded comics page, they suggest that this park bench has provided a restful stop for many weary visitors.",

Dance studio advertisements above are so crisp that their texts read like an optometrist's chart at 20/20 vision.When Brett Weston came across this facade, he must have been attracted to its striking visual geometry: the almost-identical pairs of dancers in the advertisements and the script \"Whelan's\" repeated twice over the drugstore windows. The way in which Weston composed this picture further emphasizes its rhythmic patterns. Weston chose the right time of day and printed the photograph with high contrast to create alternating, horizontal bands of light and dark.After joining a photographic unit of the Signal Corps during World War II, Weston was sent to New York City to study photography. But his already-considerable skill enabled him to complete assignments quickly, leaving time to pursue his own photographic interests. In his free time, Weston wandered the city with a cumbersome 8-by-10-inch camera and made images such as this, in which the literal and the abstract coexist.  Such dual qualities became a consistent thread throughout his oeuvre.",

The angel holds a bishop's miter and crozier formerly belonging to Saint Lambert. To the right, the Pope and two cardinals go out into a brick enclosure, meeting a lawyer or noble and a Franciscan friar, who both kneel before the papal retinue and present petitions requesting benefits or indulgences. In the far distance, on the steps of the early Saint Peter's Cathedral, Pope Sergius presents Saint Hubert with the bishop's miter and staff.The artists made an imaginative effort to recreate Rome as it would have appeared at that time. The depiction of minutely detailed objects and the ability to portray space in a convincing manner were among the major achievements of Netherlandish painters in the 1400s.The Dream of Pope Sergiusand its companion,The Exhumation of Saint Hubertin the National Gallery, London, were probably wings from a lost altarpiece that stood in the Chapel of Saint Hubert in the church of Saint Gudule, Brussels.",

Oddly, the artist did not match the patterns of the sleeves, as would have been customary during this period.In fact, the duchess never actually sat for this portrait, which may account for the misunderstood representation of her clothing. Scholars believe that the artist copied Isabella's likeness from a lost portrait by Rogier van der Weyden. The tender, slightly mocking expression on the duchess's face and the elongated fingers reflect van der Weyden's concept of portraiture.The prominent inscription in the upper left corner of the panel,PERSICA SIBYLLA IA,suggests that the portrait was part of a series depicting sibyls. This identity strikingly contrasts with Duchess Isabella's costume.

Composed of two parts, one form twists and curves upward, suggesting the distinct, massive horn of a ram. The second, more compact form evokes the long-faced shape of the skull. Its indentations suggest the hollow space of the eye sockets and mouth. But each part also clearly departs from a naturalistic depiction. In fact, it is not the forms themselves but their varied surfaces--furrowed and grained or smooth and polished--that most acutely conjure up a craggy, decaying skeleton. It is as if we have stumbled upon some slightly unfamiliar archeological find.Jack Zajac's inspiration to sculpt a ram's skull came from casually squeezing balls of wax into shapes he found appealing. According to the artist, he noticed a striking resemblance to an animal's skull in the wax's contours. Zajac then elaborated this form into a more immediately recognizable image. TheRam's Skullseries is comprised of fourteen unique sculptures. Several of the sculptures, like this one, are made up of two discrete parts. The decision to separate the skull and horn arose when a plaster Zajac was working on broke in two and he appreciated the effect of this \"accident.\"Zajac builds his plaster models by hand and carves directly into the surface using hand-axes and chisels. The bronze is then cast from the plaster. Here, the metal's rough-hewn surface accurately reflects the rugged contours of the plaster's exterior.",

In exploring his ideas, Zuccaro flipped the paper over, proceeding naturally from one project to the other. Whether completely spontaneous or more finished, energy and expressiveness characterize his line.The studies on the verso are connected with decorations that Zuccaro completed in a Roman chapel in 1556. Despite their sketchy appearance, he probably drew them at a late stage in the design process because they correspond closely to figures in the fresco.

Federico Zuccaro included himself in the scene, aged two or three and clinging behind his mother's skirts. Giorgio Vasari, the Renaissance author and painter, mentioned this event in hisLives of Painters, Sculptors and Architects, noting that Taddeo \"went off alone, at the age of fourteen, to Rome.\" In his own copy of Vasari's book, Federico elaborated on Vasari's account: \"when Taddeo grew older and able to judge things for himself, realizing that there was little more that he could learn from his father . . . and that he was still not experienced enough to be of any help to him, at the age of fourteen he went by himself to Rome.\"",

The figure of Study is hard at work drawing a nude torso, surrounded by a rooster and various other sculptures. Intelligence, on the right, holds a caduceus in his right hand, while an elephant peers out beside him.The drawing's irregular shape and viewpoint suggest to scholars that it was intended for a ceiling decoration.",

Pan personifies carnal lust, so their struggle represents the combat of divine and earthly love. The subject comes from a popular quotation from the Roman poetVirgil: \"Love conquers all.\" The scene is set inArcadia, a romantic paradise inhabited bynymphsand shepherds. Around Cupid and Pan, various figures gesture as they watch the two gods struggle. A wingedallegoricalfigure soars above, catching the attention of several figures below.This scene may derive from the central vault of the Sala d'Ercole (Room ofHercules) in the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, which was painted by Federico Zuccaro.",

        "description": "Using red chalk in a highly detailed manner, Federico Zuccaro depicted Saint Peter's Square in Rome as it appeared in 1603, with the Egyptian obelisk in place at the extreme left and the church dome complete. At the left, the archepiscopal palace adjoins the old facade of Saint Peter's basilica. In the center, the three-story benediction loggia begun by Pope Pius II in 1462 adjoins the loggia painted by Raphael, lightly sketched at the extreme right. The bastion for the papal guard protects the front of the Vatican entrance, and statues of saints Peter and Paul from the 1400s adorn the foot of the staircase.On the verso, Zuccaro drew a young boy with great intimacy, using the same medium--black and red chalk--and the same delicacy of touch seen in his other late portrait studies. Zuccaro's use of color was innovative: scholars recognize him as the first Italian of his time to combine black with red chalk, a technique practiced earlier by Hans Holbein.",

In the foreground, graceful nude figures lounge or pose elegantly like statues, while two small boys urinate into a stream that flows into a small pool. In the background, figures dance in a circle; high above in the distance, others sit on a hill and watch wild animals at play.Jacopo Zucchi made this highly finished compositional study, or modello, for the small scale paintingThe Age of Gold, now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. The Golden Age, the first of four ages of the world in classical mythology, followed immediately after the world's creation and was an earthly paradise akin to the Christian Garden of Eden.",
