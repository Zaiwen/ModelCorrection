Indian Pass Scholars have long proclaimed Cole the ""father"" of the first native school of American painting. Dubbed the Hudson River School, the movement is perhaps more accurately described as the American branch of 19th-century Romantic landscape painting. A British-born American transplant, Cole created a distinct niche for American scenery by isolating its constituent parts: majestic mountains, brilliant skies, abundant wilderness, flowing rivers, and flaming autumn trees, all of which he celebrates in . In this classic Hudson River School landscape, sunlight illuminates a glorious wilderness scene, filled with fallen branches, lichen-covered woods, and framing trees that give way to a towering mountain that pierces passing clouds. In the foreground, blasted trees suggest the inevitable passage of time while the Native American figure, bow in hand, introduces a nostalgic element; by 1847, when this work was painted, Native Americans no longer inhabited the scenic wilderness Cole depicts.

Her alert pose, intense gaze, and upper-body posture contrast with the seemingly relaxed position of her lower body, an instance of how Sargent seemed to capture, as one critic wrote, ""the nervous tension of the age."" Sears played an important role in a number of artists' careers by buying their works and providing additional support. Together with her friend, and often rival, art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner, Sears served as a preeminent Boston tastemaker at the turn of the 20th century. In addition, Sears was an accomplished painter and photographer who exhibited her work in important international exhibitions such as the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago and the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo, New York. In this painting, Sears's satin dress exemplifies Sargent's extraordinary skill at rendering white, subtly nuanced with painterly flourishes of lavender, blue, and pink.

This European \xe9migr\xe9 developed a quality of playfulness, grace, and charm-hallmarks of his style-by distilling references to both folk art and the newer trends in abstraction in American art at the time. Nadelman's sculptures derive from observed nature: specifically performers, entertainers, members of elite and vaudeville society, pianists, conductors, hosts and hostesses, and, as illustrated here, dancing couples. To produce this work, Nadelman used cherry wood. He brushed the surface with gesso and then painted each figure, wiping and rubbing the wood in order to create an aged, roughened surface that resembles the American folk art sculptures he admired and collected. Here, an elegantly dressed gentleman in black tie guides his graceful partner through the steps of the tango, a Latin American dance craze that raged in Europe and the United States during and after World War I. Although the tango is well known for its seductive qualities, this one is danced by a buttoned-up pair who perform its steps far from the ports of Buenos Aires. Nadelman simplifies forms, refining the curves and counter-curves, the masses and counter-masses. This sculpture becomes a playful image of the couple suspended in motion, gliding toward each other. Indeed, Nadelman's skill resides in isolating the sexual energy of the dance and filling the empty spaces between the man and the woman, capturing the charged moment just before their hands clasp.","American, born Poland",Elie Nadelman,1882,1946,f099154c7964

Seated in a Windsor-back armchair, the artist turns slightly and directs his gaze toward the viewer. He tilts his palette toward the viewer, and with his right hand dips his brush into the paint appearing on the palette. Without actually gripping the brush, daughter Angelica Kauffmann Peale (1775-1853) playfully appears to guide it with one hand, as her other hand points toward heaven, as if she is playing the allegorical muse of painting. To the left of the artist, Rachel Brewer Peale (1744-1790), the artist's wife, peers out of the painted canvas with an expression as life-like as those of the artist and daughter. In other words, Peale seems to beg the viewer to consider issues of illusion and reality, and the artist's magical ability to transform mere pigment (as suggested by the blobs of paint revealed to the viewer on the palette, carefully juxtaposed with the painted canvas) into life (as revealed by the vibrantly alive portrait of his wife on the easel).

By placing him next to a column in a relaxed pose, the portrait is carefully crafted to emphasize Houston's leadership qualities. The camera\xb4s capacity to document people, places, and events was the primary impetus for early photographers such as the Meade Brothers, who took this rare daguerreotype in 1851. In photography studios of this period, daguerreotype portraits were priced by plate size. This full-plate image is the only known existing full-length portrait of Houston, who stood 6 feet 2 inches tall. As the leader of the Texas Revolution and two-term president of the short-lived Republic of Texas, Houston was a knowledgeable frontiersman and liked to dress the part. However, this portrait shows him in more-conservative attire, probably to garner mass appeal for a presidential run. uThe Meade Brothers established one of the most successful photography studios in America, capturing famous subjects including Kit Carson and Commodore Matthew Perry. This portrait was probably taken in the brothers' New York studio the year after its opening, in 1850. Growing competition between portrait studios at the time led them to offer diverse options. Here, a papier-m\xe2ch\xe9 column demonstrates the trend toward incorporating props into portraiture, This work is rare because it is a full-plate image of a recognized subject by a recognized studio. The lithograph of this photograph enabled the image to appear in publications, but the daguerreotype was long thought to be lost. Discovered in 1990, it was acquired by the MFAH shortly thereafter.","American, born England;American, born England",Charles Richard Meade;Henry Meade,1826,1858,5e96d9c5301c

Because the American colonies lacked patron-aristocrats, the earliest manifestations of style occurred not in painting or sculpture but in the decorative arts.

John Coney was the first in this country to have fabricated several forms, including the inkstand, fork, sugar box, chafing dish, monteith, and chocolate pot. He was equally adept as an engraver, executing the copper plates for Massachusetts and New Hampshire paper currency. Coney's known work in the Mannerist and Baroque aesthetics establishes him as the most accomplished and versatile of all colonial silversmiths. This tankard is a consummate American expression of early Baroque silver. The vessel was made for John Foster, a prosperous Boston merchant and prominent official with sophisticated taste and lofty aspirations.

The juxtaposition of textured and flat surfaces, and matte and glossy passages, imparts a great liveliness to the surface, creating a perfect counterbalance to the dark tones of the painting. The Profanation of the Host This work is the only painting and final piece in a series of more than 40 drawings Gorky produced from 1930 to 1934. The first sketches of the series were based on Paolo Uccello's 15th-century panel Nighttime, Enigma and Nostalgia , echoing its fractured space and exaggerated perspective. As the series progressed, Gorky turned his attention to more concrete details, and in particular he chose to isolate and elaborate upon the biomorphic forms that dominated the left half of his drawings. This shift introduced a new and concentrated note of psychological intensity into Gorky's work. Nighttime, Enigma and Nostalgia u is a summation painting, the definitive statement of all of Gorky's influences and concerns in the early 1930s. Cubism and Surrealism, as well as the artist's wide knowledge of the history of art, are brilliantly assimilated into the work.

Unusual for Cassatt, however, is the work's looser application of paint, its off-center composition, and its emphasis on the landscape. The bright sunlight knits the composition together; brilliant colors sweep through the canvas; and expertly articulated figures show the artist's disciplined draftsmanship and her ability to make them lifelike through careful dabs of paint.

A solid technician in the studio, Benton pioneered a painterly technique of applying pigment with egg yolk and water, and then overlaying the surface with transparent glazes.

Using a seemingly unsophisticated style, Hicks concentrated on images that conveyed his Quaker beliefs.",American,Edward Hicks,1780,1849,c3e48f8c9b56

As a craftsman, Yellin believed in working out his designs in three-dimensional ""sketches"" in iron. These small studies show the blacksmith's process and creativity as ""expressed with the hammer."" uYellin's ironwork was commissioned for the private homes of the Vanderbilts and the DuPonts as well as for public spaces at Harvard University and the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. This example demonstrates Yellin's extraordinary ability to manipulate metal. The naturalistic tendrils have been hand-pulled, giving the impression that the material is far more pliable than it is in reality.","American, born Poland",Samuel Yellin,1885,1940,a40bf68b93b2

Critically lauded as innovative and expressive, the new work almost eclipsed her past objects. The signature pots from this period are a series of complex, often large-scale chalices. Assembled from thrown and hand-built forms, the chalices are totemic, sculptural compositions that demonstrate true harmony between form and glaze. Wood's interest in ceramics was initially stirred by the purchase of six Dutch lusterware plates in 1933. Eager for a matching teapot, she enrolled in a ceramics class. After establishing her own studio, Wood created forms that were the result of free exploration, with experimental glazes. For the next 40 years, she made thrown and hand-built vessels and figures in a range of colors and textures. At once vivid and subtle, her glazes had depth and tonal richness and seemed to be molded with light. This spectrum was achieved through her all-over, in-glaze luster that, when fired, caused metallic salts to rise to the surface, a complex process almost impossible to control. Wood's metallic sheens were unlike any glaze being used by modern potters.",American,Beatrice Wood,1893,1998,430ec29387a7

In both form and glaze, his works boldly demonstrate a command of material that has been honed by years of experimentation. Since early in his career, DeVore's palette has consisted of flesh tones, ranging from blush to bone. The surfaces of his vessels often feature a delicate craquelure pattern that is created by painstakingly layering coats of glaze. Because of the varied techniques he uses to administer the glazes, DeVore's pieces unfold in layers as they are continually explored, This vessel's undulating rim and graceful curves are reminiscent of Constantin Brancusi's work as well as the marble sculpture of ancient Italy and Greece. During this early period, DeVore focused on the torso form. The anthropomorphic lines of this vessel clearly delineate the human anatomy and allow for a greater sense of intimacy between the viewer and the vessel.",American,Richard Devore,1933,2006,c52850469492
