http://www.janm.org/collections/clara-breed-collection/,Written on inner flap of envelope: I hope you'll / be able to use the / ticket I enclosed - I cannot.,"1 letter and envelope from Louise Ogawa to Clara Breed.  Transcription:<br>January 6, 1942 / Dear Miss Breed, / I received the sweater and my brother's shorts. Thank you very very much for going through so much trouble for me. You need not have hurried in buying them. I wish you had shopped during your leisure time. Thank you again. The shorts are just fine. They fit perfectly. My sweater is excellent. I just love it!!! I am sorry I did not mention the price. Hearing that sweaters have gone up I did not write the price. No, you need not worry about the cost because I intended to pay about that much. / I was very glad to hear you liked the flowers. I wish I could have sent 10 dozen Am. beauty roses (red ones) to show my appreciation for everything you have done for me. / In my last letter I said the fence was torn down--well, it is up again. This time a few feet further out. We have been told that the reason for the fence building was so the cattle won't come near our homes. In other words cattle is going to be grazed outside the fence. But as yet, we have not seen any. Yes, I think the fence tends to weaken the morale of the people. / New Year's I attended the New Year Festival which was held in Camp II. It was held 3 days, Jan. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. There were various exhibits. The Camp II Industry exhibit--displayed various kinds of things made by the department. Education was very interesting too. There the work of the school children were displayed. Agriculture was another. In this building were many different kinds of vegetation. They were very green and looked as fresh as a daisy. The one I enjoyed most was the Arts and Craft. The longest line was in front of this building. My girl friend and I actually waited half an hour in line. It was worth the waiting time, I thought. Men have gone to cut mesquite trees and have made lovely flower vases out of them. The crooked branches and the bumpiest ones make the prettiest vases. In the vases there were many varieties of artificial flowers. Many beautiful canes were made too. Such things as ash trays, book ends, pencil holders, fruit baskets, vases, little jewelry chests, and crocket and checker sets were made out of mesquite. / When we saw the rolls and rolls of beautiful artificial flowers--chrysanthimums / in a green house, after standing in the hot sun, it gave us a refreshing feeling. I wish you could have been there. / We had our annual ""mochi tsuki""; making rice cakes. Our parents were very happy to be able to eat ""mochi"" again. No one ever dreamed of eating them again. The govt. is very good to us and I am truly grateful. / We now have oil stoves in our homes and school. But it does little good because you have to be near the stove in order to receive any heat. By keeping all the windows closed the room may become warm, but we were warned against it. Several people have been sent to the hospital because they did not leave any windows open -- they inhaled the fume which comes out of the stove. / In school the stove is in one corner and I am in the opposite corner so the warmth does not come near me. It certainly took a long time to get the stoves because of too much red tape involved. We still have no books to study out of. We are taught the progressive way. It is like a lecture form. / The teacher talks and we take notes. When test time comes we have to study our notes. I hope by next semester we will be able to study from books. / I have been having trouble about my credits because we did not get credit for the last semesters work. I am lacking 1/2 credit for graduation this June. But with the help of our Vice principal, Mr. Tashiro, I will be able to graduate. / We now have a school constitution. A student from each Case Studies class (history and English classes) formed the Constitutional Convention. At the present time it is being ratified. Next week we are going to have election of Student Body officers. / This morning we had an assembly at which time we had the opportu","Letter to Clara Breed from Louis Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, January 6, 1942",Clara Breed Collection,Louise Ogawa,Gift of Elizabeth Y.

http://www.janm.org/collections/benji-okubo-collection/,Torn typed label on verso:  Portrait -- Benji Okubo.,"Stretched and framed.  Portrait of man in profile wearing a cowboy hat with Heart Mountain in the background.  Dressed in a red collared shirt and eyeglasses, he appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s.  His proper left profile is shown and his head is tilted slightly downward.  His appearance is rather bohemian, with a goatee and a scraggly mustache.  In the background Heart Mountain looms in the bottom left corner, above a meandering river and the sky is dark and cloudy.  The artist uses a palette of muted colors (pale coral, soft gold, icy aqua and warm peach) to bring a sense of color harmony to the canvas.  The figure is centrally placed in the canvas, and the diagonal thrust to his neck provides a more dynamic composition.  To accentuate details within the figure, the artist used fine contour lines, especially about the features (eyes, ears, nose, and lips) and the waves of the hair.  The style of painting is realistic with elements of Asian calligraphic brush strokes in the finer details.  Frame has light hint of green paint.  The painting is a study of a man lost in introspection.  Although the uniquely shaped mountain identifies the location as Heart Mountain, Wyoming, the man's thoughts appear to be far away.  By showing Heart Mountain in the background however, the artist appears to be contrasting the man reflecting on his previous life compared to the confines of the present.",Untitled,Benji Okubo Collection,Benji Okubo,Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.9_a.jpg,"H: 10 in, W: 8 in",4d7f07c9760f

She has red hair and brows, bright salmon pink lips, and  pink-beige tone skin.  Wearing in a green dress with a small gold and teal flower print throughout, yellow ruffles at the cuff, and a banded white neck trim with pink stitching, the woman faces left with her face turned so that nearly all of her proper left profile is shown.  A few inches from her face, a small mint-green Christ on the crucifix floats head first downward at top left.  A mission-style church and rows of tombstones are in the distance over her proper right shoulder, bottom right.  The sky is painted a bright lemon yellow, darkening to a shade of yellow orange at the horizon. The painting is rendered in a softly modeled manner, where the colors are so well blended that no visible brush strokes can be detected in the background and larger areas of the face.  To show the detail in the hair, brows, lashes, eyes, ears, nose, lips and hands, the artist employs extremely delicate rendered contour lines.  In particular, the lines comprising the strands of hair are flowing and rhythmic.  The woman is centrally placed in the canvas and her eyes, the Christ figure and her hands in prayer, and her swooping white collar all help to lead the viewer's eyes through the painting, and to the focal point -- the interaction between the woman and Christ figure.  The majority of colors in this painting are warm tones -- yellow, apricot, orange, peach and coral -- lending a golden glow to the overall painting.  Notably, the Christ and the church are green, setting them apart from the rest of the painting.  The style of the painting is similar to Hideo Date's paintings, having a basis in Stanton MacDonald-Wright's synchromism movement with its emphasis on color harmony. balance of form and rhythmic lines.  The inclusion of the floating Christ figure, however, touches upon a surrealistic style.  Naturalistic surrealism in a 20th century movement in art in which recognizable scenes are transformed into a dream or nightmare image.",Stretched and framed.,Untitled,Benji Okubo Collection,Benji Okubo,Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.13_a.jpg,"H: 18 in, W: 16 in,  Frame: 23.5 x 21.5 in",a938954a3ffc

Young and attractivve, she wears a bright lime hair band with flowers tucked underneath and what appears to be a corsage on her lapel.<br>The artist uses a pallete of muted complementary colors, primarily reds (as coral and rose) and greens (as lime, sage and sea foam green).  The usage of these colors side by side serve to brighten their hues and give the painting a luminosity and brightness.  The bust of the woman is centrally placed in the canvas, and the image is cropped at the top of her head.  The shading is softly modeled, and the fine details of the woman's hair, brows, eyes, lips, nose and ears are rendered in precise and elegant contour lines.  The hair in particular has a grace and rhythmic quality in its fluid lines.  The style of the painting is influenced by synchronism and is similar to Hideo Date's portraits; both depict graceful and solid women using a balance of form, rhythm and color harmony to attract and excite the viewer.  The woman depicted is young, lovely and full of vitality.  The flowers in her hair and boom emphasize the freshness of youth.  The glow of light on her face seems to reflect an inner glow in her character.

Portrait of a woman with green skin and blue hair, eyes and lips.  Head and shoulders are depicted.  Her hair hangs loosely around her shoulders.  The woman is depicted a three-quarters facial view of the proper left side of her face.  She wears a vivid burgandy dress, patterned with salmon pink, green and gold stylized patterns; a brooch of a scorpion is pinned on bosom and bold red earrings dangle from her ears.  The woman is positioned centrally within the canvas and her neck and head are titled diagonally.  The artist uses bold primary colors --blue, red and yellow--and their respective complements--orange, green and violet-- to bring a sense of dynamism to the painting.  The bright colors instantly attract the viewer.  Upon closer examination, the viewer can note how the face, neck, and shoulders are gently shaded to indicate bone structure and musculature.  The brush strokes are loose in these areas.  The finer details of the hair, eyes, nose and lips, however, are rendered in a more delicate style--with precise and tight brush strokes.  In particular, the hair has a rhythmic quality in its repeated linear brush strokes.  The green pattern on the woman's dress is reminiscent of formalized Japanese kimono pattern.  The style of the painting is similar to Hideo Date's paintings -- both have a basis in Stanton MacDonald-Wright's sychromism movement with its emphasis on color harmony, balance and rhythmic lines.  The woman depicted is beautiful, with a muscularity and solidness.  The artist seems to depict her character through her full yet firm curve of her lips, her flared nostrils and the arch of her eyebrows.

http://www.janm.org/collections/benji-okubo-collection/,Written on verso:  61 Henry 12/12.,"Stretched and unframed.  Image of a giant hand reaching down from yellow swirling clouds in the sky to grasp a struggling green skinned man with red hair above landscape.  Dressed in an orange shirt and salmon pants, the barefoot man reaches up with his proper right hand to grasp at cloud at right.  Below, a lake of green water is surrounded by dusty pink mountains.  Tiny yellow buildings rest on the edge of the lake and what appears to be barely discernable figures crowd the edge of the painting.  Pale moon rises in background behin a dead and gnarled tree in foreground right.  <br>The painting is structured very dramatically with the diagonal line of the enormous fist and the diagonal line of the writhing man crating an ""x"" in the center of the canvas.  The bright colors of the man and the clouds contrast with the somber darkness of the giant hand.  The style of the painting is naturalistic surrealism -- a 20th century art movement in which recognizable scenes are transformed into dreamlike or nightmarish images.  The painting seems to be an antiwar or anti concentration camp statement.  The man is struggling but he is powerless to fight the giant fist that encloses him.  Although the man writes and claws at the air, he has nowhere to go except into a barren landscape with a dead tree.  The tree, once a living symbol of life and vitality, is a wretched reminder of what once was.  The giant hand is like the hand of God or fate of destiny -- an unstoppable force that has ultimate control over the lives of man.  The tiny people in the background seem to be watching this struggle, but it seems clear that man will not be the victor of his fate.  In the same way that the Japanese Americans were virtually powerless pawns manipulated by the power of the government and entrapped in concentration camps, the man is trapped by powers stronger than himself.  It appears that this painting is a metaphor for the Japanese Americans during World War II.",Untitled,Benji Okubo Collection,Benji Okubo,Gift of Chisato Okubo,oil; canvas,http://media.janm.org/collections/2003.159.20A_a.jpg,"H: 14 in, W: 12 in",5015a832022b
