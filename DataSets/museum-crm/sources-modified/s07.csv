Swaying under the weight of her pail and squinting into the sun, she presents the ideal of natural womanhood. Her powerful presence, marked by broad shoulders, muscular arms, and sunburned skin, counters the farmhand's relaxed stance and shaded face, visually reversing traditional gender roles.

In the painting, Achilles has been disguised as a woman and hidden among the daughters of King Lycomedes at the behest of his mother, who knows that he is fated to die if he goes to Troy.

In this scene set in the Adirondack region of New York State, earthen colors link the hunter and the environment, making it difficult to distinguish the man from the hill behind him. Homer visited the Adirondacks as one of many vacationers who flocked there in the late nineteenth century.

Best known for biblical history pictures, romantic portraits, and landscapes, Allston was also a poet and novelist.
