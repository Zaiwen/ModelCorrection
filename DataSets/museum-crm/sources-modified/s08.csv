Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West,Isa Melsheimer,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/12-03-Isa-Melsheimer.jpg,"Isa Melsheimer: Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West is a never-before-seen installation that explores Hollywood s cinematic heyday and its motion picture icons, investigating notions of glamour and luxury as they relate to characters, architecture, and locations in and around Los Angeles.\nSanta Monica Museum of Art Deputy Director Lisa Melandri is curator of Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West, in which the artist utilizes commonplace, and largely domestic materials, to create site-specific environments, including a mixture of altered and embroidered t-shirts, live plants, paper, pearls, yarn constructions, and cast concrete sculptures.\nDuring a 2007 residency at Villa Aurora a nonprofit organization located in Pacific Palisades dedicated to German-American cultural exchange Melsheimer became interested in Los Angeles s landscape and architecture, as well as the fictional and historical characters that inhabit these spaces.\nInfluenced by classic Hollywood films such as David Lynch s Mulholland Drive and Billy Wilder s Sunset Boulevard, and the stories of James Graham Ballard, Melsheimer examines the affects of architecture and location on Los Angeles s glamorized cinematic figures; as well as the demise of those figures from lifestyles of fame and financial success. Melsheimer is particularly drawn to examples such as the Salton Sea, a former glamorous resort area new Palm Springs that has since degenerated into a kind of wasteland, and the character Norma Desmond and her shabby mansion from Wilder s iconic film.\nWith Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West, Melsheimer wants viewers to be aware that architecture is always representative of ideas or subjects that permeate society. She asks viewers to consider: Which fictional and historical subjects are admired within Los Angeles? Why do residents emigrate from Los Angeles? What aesthetics characterize Los Angeles s buildings; and what sentiments manifest in the region s architecture?\nSome content may be deemed inappropriate for younger viewers.\nSupport for Isa Melsheimer: Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West has been provided in part by Institut f鐪塺 Auslandsbeziehungen e.V.鑱絓nAbout the artist:Melsheimer (b. 1968) was born in Neuss, Germany, and lives and works in Berlin. She attended the Hochschule der K鐪塶ste (Academy of Fine Arts), Berlin, and completed a master class with painter Georg Baselitz.\nMelsheimer s work has been shown in solo exhibitions in museums and galleries throughout Europe, including in Paris at Galerie Jocelyn Wolff, in N鍗痬es at Mus鑼卐 d Art Contemporain, in Vienna at Galerie N鐩瞔hst St. Stephan, in Berlin at Esther Schipper Gallery, in Switzerland at Kunsthaus Langenthal, in Maastricht, Netherlands at Bonnefantenmuseum, and in Marfa, Texas at The Chinati Foundation.

Origin of the Universe,Mickalene Thomas,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/12-2-Interior-Blue-Couch.jpg,"Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe鑱絠s鑱絫he first major solo museum exhibition for the New York-based multi-media artist. Best known for her elaborate paintings of African American women against the backdrop of d鑼卌or recalled from her childhood, Thomas has created an all-new suite of works that examine aspects of landscape painting. She introduces a new model of trans-generational female empowerment as she explores interior and exterior environments in relation to the female figure. The exhibition opens at SMMoA on April 14, 2012 and continues through August 18, 2012. It will then travel to the Brooklyn Museum for display from September 28, 2012 to January 20, 2013.\nThomas is best known for her bold enamel and acrylic paintings adorned with rhinestones, glitter, and  bling.  Her subjects seem to have stepped directly from a 1970s Blaxploitation film, yet Thomas s influences extend far beyond. Her oeuvre stems from her long study of art history and the classical genres of portraiture, landscape, and still life. Thomas s layered鑱絝acture鑱絧rocess begins with a photographic portrait that is translated into a collage, and ultimately reenvisioned as a painting. Her imagery comprises careful borrowings from art history and from contemporary popular culture.\nFor鑱絆rigin of the Universe, Thomas examines art historical constructs of feminine identity, sexuality, beauty, and power in 15 works in a variety of sizes, shapes, and media. Taking cues from Marcel Duchamp s鑱借劇tant Donn鑼卻: 1?la chute d eau, 2?le gaz d 鑼卌lairage?Given: 1.鑱絋he Waterfall, 2.鑱絋he Illuminating Gas) and Gustave Courbet s L Origine du Monde (The Origin of the World), Thomas presents the female figure as the origin of the universe, focusing on how the female body both engenders and inhabits landscape. The works on view are in communication with one another portraits of Qusuquzah and Din gaze out at modernist interiors and plein-air landscapes, all confronted by the artist s arresting recreations of Courbet s Origin.\nIn nineteenth-century visual culture, black female sexuality functioned as something to be rejected or disparaged, but Thomas reconfigures these historical tropes into contemporary statements of empowerment. By casting African American women as the  heroines  of her works, she makes a profound statement regarding gender and racial identity. Thomas s dialogue with Courbet and Duchamp is a strong reclamation of history, reasserting the subjective nature of beauty. In addition to her paintings and photographs, she will create an installation in SMMoA s Project Room 1, to reinvent鑱借劇tant Donn鑼卻, where the  peep show  reveals the true surprise of a 70s-style paneled interior in the place of Duchamp s splayed female body.\nSome content may be deemed inappropriate for younger viewers.\nMickalene Thomas was born in 1971. She earned a Bachelor s of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute and a Master s of Fine Arts from Yale University. She has participated in residency programs at the Versailles Foundation Munn Artists Program, Giverny, France, and the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York. Her work has been shown in group exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, The Renaissance Society, Chicago, and MoMA PS1, New York, and is included in the important collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Solomon R.

Mirror House,Kelly Barrie,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Mirror_House_onweb.jpg,"Kelly Barrie: Mirror House is a new, large-format photographic work created especially for Project Room 1 at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Including drawing, dance, performance, and digital collage, Barrie s work investigates the relationship between historical memory and aesthetic practice in this case, using Hurricane Katrina as the backdrop.\nBarrie uses images of the effects of traumatic events as his artistic source material. Mirror House began with a found photograph of a flooded house and tree from New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. The ghost image of the scene evokes a dreamscape rather than a pictorial representation of a calamity. The end result is a poignant, Surrealist-like mural that transforms a real-life disaster into a disorienting but beautiful reverie.\nBarrie s multi-dimensional process combines many artistic genres. He  performs  his response to found photographs on his studio floor by literally drawing the image with his feet, dragging photo-luminescent pigment on black paper with toe drags, heel spins, snake walks, and foot sweeps. He then photographs his  drawing  with a 35 mm camera utilizing natural daylight stored in the light-sensitive powder. The powder s light is released by using the vertical blinds in the studio as a type of aperture. More than seventy photographs were taken with a grid system to document the drawing. Barrie then digitally stitched these photographs together to construct the finished work which is both haunting and painterly.\nThis exhibition has been supported by David Knaus.

"Career  Woman閳ユ弴rawings, Paintings, Vessels, and Objects",Beatrice Wood,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/12-2-green.jpg,"Beatrice Wood: Career Woman閳ユ弴rawings, Paintings, Vessels, and Objects offers a comprehensive survey and a new assessment of this emblematic California artist a scholarly, commemorative evaluation of Wood, whose extraordinary life and career traversed and contributed to the cultural and artistic highlights of the entire 20th century. SMMoA Executive Director Elsa Longhauser and Deputy Director Lisa Melandri are co-curators for the exhibition.\nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman is part of Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980. This unprecedented collaboration, initiated by the Getty, brings together more than sixty cultural institutions from across Southern California for six months beginning October 2011 to tell the story of the birth of the L.A. art scene. An artist who worked on both the East and West coasts and bridged gaps between areas as disparate as New York Dada and Southern California ceramics, Wood (1893-1998) was a vital contributor to the art scene of the period and is thus a key player in the Pacific Standard Time project.\nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman includes over 100 works of art. The exhibition begins with Wood s early Dada work, which includes drawings, paintings, posters, prints, and illustrated albums and travelogues. Wood first encountered Dada a primary creative and personal influence in New York, arising from her intimate friendships with Marcel Duchamp and the collectors Walter and Louise Arensberg. It was Dada that first inspired Wood to become an artist, and it shaped her creative thinking for the rest of her life. The exhibition also feature prominent examples of Wood s ceramics created from the 1940s until her death in 1998. Wood was exceptionally prolific, even given her remarkable longevity. She repeatedly investigated and revisited a number of subjects, forms, and materials over a 60- to 70-year period.\nThough Wood did not turn to ceramics until 1933 at the age of 40, she became an accomplished clay artist and went on to produce some of her most notable works well into her 90s. Her experimentation with ceramic glazing and firing was extraordinary, a compendium of clay technique. She first began to experiment with clay pieces that took the form of tiles or plates. By the 1980s, Wood was creating objects on a much larger scale, such as colossal goblets more than a foot tall and wide. The exhibition will survey the full range of her ceramics from the miniature to the large-scale, from the utilitarian to the decorative, and from the vessel to figurative sculpture.\nA fully-illustrated 144-page comprehensive catalog, published by the Santa Monica Museum of Art, accompanies the exhibition and offers a scholarly assessment of Beatrice Wood. This elegant publication includes 58 full-color plates, over 90 photographs, forward and acknowledgements by curators Elsa Longhauser and Lisa Melandri, original texts by Garth Clark, Kathleen Pyne and Jenni Sorkin, Wood s original diaries annotated and edited by Francis M. Naumann and Marie T. Keller, and a chronology by Lida M. Sunderland. The catalog s essays range from the examination of Wood s threshold position in early modernism, to her relationship with the Theosophical community in Ojai, as well as a technical evaluation of her work in clay. Wood began her life in art as a dilettante, and emerged a serious artist, nearly fifty years later. The accompanying writings illuminate the evolution of her work and document the art historical trajectory that delineates her vibrant contribution to the canon of Twentieth Century art.\nWood created a complex, thoughtful, and inexhaustible oeuvre, one that is equal parts narrative and form, equal parts poetry and wit. Her irrepressible sensibility could be bold, audacious, insouciant, sexually charged, and at times biographical. This exhibition will honor Wood s indomitable spirit and dynamic artistic force, a pairing that produced a mature body of work that defines her importance as an artist.

Wire Instruments and Pet Stains,Al Taylor,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Peabody.jpg,"Al Taylor: Wire Instruments and Pet Stains is the first American survey of work by this important and prolific artist. The exhibition features two major series in Taylor s vast oeuvre: Wire Instruments (1989-1990) and Pet Stains (1989-1992). These distinctive bodies of work will illustrate the importance of Taylor s process and creative breadth.\nTaylor was born in Springfield, Missouri in 1948. He studied at the Kansas City Art Institute and moved to New York in 1970, where he lived and worked until his death at the age of 51 from lung cancer in 1999. Taylor worked for many years as studio assistant to Robert Rauschenberg (where he met his future wife Debbie) and was acquainted with such burgeoning luminaries as James Rosenquist, Cy Twombly, and Brice Marden. Although these relationships nourished Taylor s abundant talent, his future work was inspired but not defined by these friendships. Out of financial necessity, he scavenged art materials from the street. His connection with the commonplace which remained unpredictable and deep resulted in a body of work that is singular, inventive, and eloquent.\nTaylor began his studio practice as a painter in the seventies and early eighties. By 1985, however, he had developed a unique approach to process that encompassed a synergistic relationship between two-dimensional drawings and three-dimensional assemblages. Taylor s goal was to create a new way to experience and envision space; the works from this period helped him refine his investigations of visual perception across several dimensions.  Al felt that his work was research into vision,  says Debbie Taylor.  His work is really about looking, but he used everything around him. Seeing something could lead him to making one of these pieces, that could combine with something that he d read that morning, or with some music playing on the stereo, or with something on TV. Any of those things could inspire him. \nTaylor made no distinction between his three-dimensional constructions and his drawings. Dismissing the term  sculpture,  he preferred to see the 3-D work as  drawing in space.  Fashioned from such simple elements as wooden broomsticks, wire, carpentry remnants, and other ephemera, his constructions offer a multitude of distinct points of view. Taylor s drawings, in fact, often inspired the development of his three-dimensional works, which he created as an extension, in order to  see more.  Taylor remarked that  [the work] isn t at all about sculptural concerns; it comes from a flatter set of traditions. What I am really after is finding a way to make a group of drawings that you can look around. Like a pool player, I want to have all the angles covered. \nThe drawings and constructions titled Wire Instruments show Taylor experimenting with the simplest variations of geometric form (especially the triangle). These fragile ink, pencil, and gouache drawings and wood and wire constructions have not been the focus of any previous exhibitions or scholarly investigation. Their simplicity and ephemeral beauty provide a poignant glimpse into Taylor s creative production.\nThe body of work called Pet Stains (which includes Pet Stains, Pet Names, Pet Stain Removal Devices, and the Peabody Group) portrays sensuous, abstract imagery of drop-like puddles, formulated with toner, paint, or ink on paper. The constructions in this series are made from wood and Plexiglas that is dribbled and dripped with paint of every viscosity. In this series, Taylor transformed patterns of dog urine on an urban sidewalk into art. The playful ease and subtle humor of these works is apparent: various pee-stains are often tagged with imaginary names of the dogs/artists who made them Buddy, Norman, Getty, Goya, and Everready or, with a nod to Duchamp, given such titles as Puddle Descending a Staircase, and so on. Again, as in Wire Instruments, permutation and variation on the theme is integral to his process how many pet names, how many puddles of pee can he transform into nuanced drawings or quirky constructions.\nWire Instruments and Pet Stains will include 47 works. Connie Butler, The Robert Lehman Foundation Chief Curator of Drawings at the Museum of Modern Art, will contribute a major essay to accompany the exhibition.\nMajor support for the exhibition is generously provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation.

Weisman Foundation, Susan and Leonard Nimoy, and David Zwirner, New York.\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/introduction-al-taylor-wire-instruments-and-pet-stains/,14f56ebe3a14
Recent Paintings,Daniel Cummings,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1.Metro-shadow_onweb.jpg,"Daniel Cummings: Recent Paintings is the artist s first museum exhibition. Cummings (b. 1980) is a graduate of the MFA program at UCLA in sculpture, where he transferred his interest in 3-dimensional objects to painting. His abstract work plays with space and color in a variety of scales. The result: Deceptively simple, formal compositions that belie complex figure/ground relationships.\nThis exhibition will feature six new works that investigate surface and pictorial depth, as well as the space between abstraction and figuration. In works like Metro, figures seem to emerge from shadowy environments, alluding to deep space and movement. Works like Untitled-with its central, ghostly, soft pink blur placed on background shapes in orange, blue, white, and black-deftly combine loose and semi-transparent washes with carefully wrought pictorial structure. Born in Pittsburgh, he lives and works in Los Angeles.\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/project-room-2-daniel-cummings-recent-paintings/,db9effa21e6f
"Between My Hands to Water Falling, Selected Works from 1990-2010",Andrew Lord,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/river-Spodden-at-Healey-Dell-Whitworth-III.jpg,"Andrew Lord is a British artist working in New York and the Netherlands, who, from his earliest exhibitions in the late 1970s, has explored sculptural and pictorial concerns through clay, plaster, beeswax, bronze, video, drawing, and printmaking. Lord s work transforms sensation into physical form charged with emotion, reflection, physical identity, and personal history.\nIn Lord s exhibition for SMMoA, elements from five series of works represent developments in his oeuvre from the 1990s to the present day. Breathing, biting, swallowing, tasting, smelling, listening, watching is a landmark series of forms (1992-1998) in which Lord transforms abstract sensation into material form by molding his own body into clay with repeated applications of his chest, teeth, neck, nostrils, ears and eyes. By using his body as a tool, he translates the senses hearing, seeing, tasting, feeling from their liminal states into tactile and visual objects. In another series round, modeling, marking, touching and holding, pressing and squeezing, palm, fist Lord explores the sculptural variations made by the actions and gestures of his hands.\nIn untitled series (2004), Lord observes and rebuilds the ceramics of Paul Gauguin, who has been a pivotal influence for him since the 1970s. Lord s untitled series explores Gauguin s enigmatic narrative in clay, of figures emerging from a natural landscape or engaged in everyday activity.\nMore recently in Whitworth (2009), Lord built a series of clay sculptures that record the monuments, landscapes and people of his birthplace Whitworth, in Lancashire, England. In these works he uses memory as a sense in itself, giving it three-dimensional form. By imbuing the act of remembering with corporeal potential, Lord creates a sculptural map of the town, navigating his personal history through the recognizable landmarks of Whitworth s geography. Lord is also creating river Spodden at Healey Dell, a new series of plaster and beeswax sculptures that depict abstracted elements of the river on its rocky course through Whitworth. A video of the same name, made in 2008, accompanies the sculptures.\nLord studied at Rochdale College of Art, England and later at the Central School of Art and Design, London. His work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam; and The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA. Lord has had solo exhibitions at Galerie Art   Project, Amsterdam; The Carnegie Museum of Art; Camden Arts Centre, London; and Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Enschede. His work has been included in Westkunst-Heute at the Museen dr Stadt, K鏋歭n; the 1995 Whitney Biennial; Site and Insight at PS1, New York; and The Third Mind at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.\nSMMoA is collaborating with Milton Keynes Gallery in England on the production of a major catalogue that features an interview between Lord and James Rondeau (Curator, Frances and Thomas Dittmer Chair of Contemporary Art, The Art Institute of Chicago), and an essay by independent curator and scholar, Linda Norden. The combined exhibitions at SMMoA and Milton Keynes Gallery will comprise a comprehensive survey of Lord s work.\nThe exhibition curator for Andrew Lord: between my hands to water falling, selected works from 1990 to 2010 is Elsa Longhauser, SMMoA Executive Director.\nMajor support is generously provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Abby Sher, the Frederick R.

RING,Park Studio,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Dominique.jpg,"Park Studio is the Santa Monica Museum of Art s signature free outreach program offered to neighborhood high school students during spring break. This year, SMMoA s Park Studio collaborates with the LA Opera for Ring Festival LA, which runs from April 15 to June 30, 2010. An exhibition of student work inspired by the themes of Richard Wagner s opera, Der Ring des Nibelungen, entitled Park Studio: RING, will be on view at SMMoA from May 15 through August 21, 2010. Park Studio is developed and organized by Asuka Hisa, SMMoA`s Director of Education.\nThis summer, LA Opera unveils the first complete performances of Richard Wagner`s Ring Cycle ever presented in Los Angeles. In celebration of this monumental event, LA Opera has joined forces with Los Angeles  cultural and educational institutions to stage the first significant citywide cultural festival since the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival. SMMoA s partnership with the LA Opera for Ring Festival LA aligns with the goals of the Park Studio program.\nFor Park Studio: RING, approximately twenty high school students will learn about Richard Wagner s seminal work and explore the symbolism of the ring in the opera power, jealousy, desire which has parallels in today s culture. They will participate in Ring Cycle discussions with SMMoA s educators, collaborating artists, and guest speakers, visit the backstage of the LA Opera, and enjoy a dress rehearsal of G鏋歵terd鐩瞞merung. Finally, with the help of environmental artist Gordon Bowen and his Arts ReFoundry Atelier (a portable foundry made completely from recycled materials), students will interpret the meaning and power of the ring to cast their own original bronze ring-shaped sculptures. The exhibition of the student s bronze works will be displayed at SMMoA from May 15 to August 21, 2010.\nPark Studio takes interdisciplinary art education outside museum walls and into the community. This free program is held annually during the spring break, when contemporary artists lead workshops, art history lessons, and field trips to cultural sites. Park Studio is open to high school students residing or attending school in the Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District. Students enrolled at Santa Monica`s Olympic High School, a continuation school, may receive a full semester credit toward earning their high school diploma. SMMoA presents this program in partnership with the City of Santa Monica Cultural Affairs Department and the Teen Center at Virginia Avenue Park.\nFor over 10 years, Park Studio has provided unforgettable and formative experiences for teens. Through transformative experiences of art making and collaboration with established artists and organizations, participants gain access to ideas and opportunities that have the potential to shape their adult lives.\n								",https://smmoa.org/video/park-studio-ring-at-smmoa-2/,59eac4747e16
Between Science and Magic,Diana Thater,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Greg-PresentsJosephine-Greg.jpg,"Working in film, video, and installation, Diana Thater has been an innovator in her medium for 20 years and is best known for creating complex visual and spatial environments. Between Science and Magic is a simple, and beautiful, interpretation of  movie magic -a century-old expression that still conjures the mythology of Hollywood filmmaking. Thater s project is conceived as a brief history of cinema.\nThater s new and innovatory piece recreates, and repositions, a seminal moment in Los Angeles history, when downtown LA was being dreamed into a gilded metropolis and a theater district was built to rival New York s Great White Way. Renowned magician Greg Wilson appears as if filmed within the famed Los Angeles Theatre, the most elaborate of the movie palaces built between 1911 and 1931 on Los Angeles s now-defunct  theater row.  Thus, the viewer experiences a palpable tension between past and present. The repeated performance of an archetypal magic trick-pulling a rabbit out of a hat-is captured in tones of black, white, and grey; only the magician s skin tone and the rabbit s eyes have a trace of color.\nA pioneering filmmaker, Thater s work is held in many public collections including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate, London; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She has been the subject of solo exhibitions at such prestigious institutions as the Vienna Secession; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Kunsthalle Basel; and The Renaissance Society, Chicago. Most recently, Thater s gorillagorillagorilla-a poignant study of human and animal behavior-was premiered at the Kunsthaus Graz, in collaboration with the Museum of Natural History in London, to celebrate the bicentenary of Charles Darwin s birth. Between Science and Magic is Thater s first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in over 10 years.\nSupport for the exhibition is generously provided by The Broad Art Foundation, The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation, and The Suzanne Nora Johnson and David Gordon Johnson Foundation.\n\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/diana-thater-between-science-and-magic/,3e1a550d86bc

A Collaboration between Kim Schoenstadt and Rita McBride,Tell Me Something Good,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"Inspired by the conceptual art exhibition鑱紸rt By Telephone?Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, 1969), in which participants phoned in their specifications for their works of art, artists Kim Schoenstadt and Rita McBride will exchange instructions to create their respective artworks in their first two-person U.S. Museum exhibition.鑱絋ell Me Something Good: A Collaboration between Kim Schoenstadt and Rita McBride鑱給pens at the Santa Monica Museum of Art on September 12 and will be on view through December 5, 2009.\nThe original 1969鑱紸rt By Telephone鑱絯as curated by Jan van der Marck. Its basic premise was to invite international and out-of-state artists to phone instructions that would be executed bymuseum installers. Schoenstadt and McBride have created their  exchange  as a variation of the 1969 project, with each phoning the other with instructions for a work. At SMMoA, Schoenstadt will create McBride s work according to the instructions   photographs of all the gas stations along California Highway 1 between Los Angeles International Airport and Point Dume. McBride was asked by Schoenstadt to choose a discarded drawing from her studio and load it into a fax machine, then ask the Gallery to fax the floor plans of their proposed exhibition space. The combination of interposed drawing and architectural plan provided the final composition. This work was shown at New York gallery Alexander and Bonin from May 9 through June 13, 2009.\nThe project takes up the  telephone game  idea of transforming visual information into language and back to visual, and also embraces the conceptual promise that  anyone  can make an art work based on the idea of the systemic production of art according to instruction. In the current era of instant messaging and social media, Schoenstadt and McBride use the telephone as a means of communication to initiate their conceptual works that explore the ramifications of what happens when an artist gives up control over his or her project. With its focus on collaboration and exploration of the nature of authorship, this exhibition is the perfect complement to the Allen Ruppersberg exhibition, which runs concurrently at SMMoA.\nSchoenstadt received a BFA from Pitzer College, California, and has participated in many solo and two-person exhibitions and projects in Europe and the U.S., including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and the Institute of Contemporary Art, London. Her body of work centers around the exploration of drawing, and frequently includes series in which the final product is arrived at by chance or by instructions provided either via the audience or other artists; her works are often site-specific. Schoenstadt lives and works in Venice, California.\nMcBride received a BA from Bard College, New York, and an MFA from California Institute of the Arts, Valencia. She is the recipient of many awards and residencies, including the prestigious Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2002). Her projects vary greatly from unorthodox books to large-scale sculptures. Her work has been shown at the SculptureCenter, New York, and she has had several solo museum exhibitions throughout Europe. McBride lives and works in D鐪塻seldorf, Germany where she is a professor at the Kunstakademie D鐪塻seldorf.\nThe catalog accompanying the project is a recording of each artist s instructions on a vinyl record, just as it was for the original 1969鑱紸rt By Telephone. The record will be playing in the Project Room as part of the installation; a limited edition of signed copies will be available for sale.鑱絋ell Me Something Good: A Collaboration between Kim Schoenstadt and Rita McBride鑱絠s organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art and curator Lisa Melandri, Deputy Director for Exhibitions and Programs.\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/tell-me-something-good-a-collaboration-between-kim-schoenstadt-and-rita-mcbride/,2ed46a007b62
You and Me or The Art of Give and Take,Allen Ruppersberg,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"The Santa Monica Museum of Art presents鑱紸llen Ruppersberg: You and Me or The Art of Give and Take.鑱紸mong the first generation of American conceptual artists that also includes John Baldessari, Douglas Huebler, and Bruce Nauman who redefined artistic practice during the 1970s, this exhibition features two new major interactive installations created especially for the occasion.鑱紸llen Ruppersberg: You and Me or The Art of Give and Take鑱給pens on September 12 and continues through December 19, 2009.\n We are delighted to present this exhibition at SMMoA,  states Elsa Longhauser, Executive Director.  Al is a  vernacular anthropologist  whose artistic interests and sensibilities have been indelibly shaped by the spirit and ethos of Southern California. \nRuppersberg s vast oeuvre includes paintings, prints, photographs, sculptures, installations and books that explore the intersection of art, literature, and life. His work is often participatory, like that of Allan Kaprow and others, and he finds source material in the everyday. Ruppersberg s vast collection of early to mid-twentieth-century cultural ephemera-which includes calendars, snapshots, magazines, comic books, newspaper clippings, postcards, posters, and instructional films-form the basis of much of his recent work.\nAs a teacher and artist, Ruppersberg has also influenced several Los Angeles artists of the generation following his, including, most notably, Jim Shaw and Mike Kelley, whose works also deal with the American vernacular. East Coast artist Rachel Harrison, who incorporates a deluge of cultural debris in her sculptures-celebrity magazines, costume jewelry, canned goods, and wigs-has acknowledged Ruppersberg s importance in the development of her own work. Ruppersberg has always had a strong, independent vision shaped first by growing up in America s heartland and also by spending months and years living and working in New York and Europe, where his work has been shown in an array of major museums.\nTwo new large-scale installations in this exhibition continue to expand Ruppersberg s use of imagery culled from his vast archive of twentieth-century ephemera.鑱絋he Never Ending Book Part 2/Art and Therefore Ourselves?2009), is a selection of more than 15,000 pages of Xeroxed images from the artist s book collection, installed in a stage-like environment made of theatrical props and early twentieth-century mural-sized vintage posters. The pages are stacked in approximately fifty small cardboard boxes designed by the artist. These duplicated pages are free for the taking. In this way, Ruppersberg makes his library available to each audience member who can subsequently create his or her own unique  book  to take home. As part of this project, Ruppersberg has created a 33 RPM vinyl LP record, which functions as an oral analog to the books on view. The record includes old songs and hymns, spoken word recordings, recipes read by poet Bill Berkson, and people singing around the piano, all dating from the early to mid-20th century.\nFor the second installation,鑱絋he Sound and the Story/The Hugo Ball Award for 20th Century Graphics?2009), photocopied and laminated items of everyday ephemera from Ruppersberg s extensive collection are suspended from a wall of pegboards. Viewers are invited to rearrange the materials on the pegboard to create their own narrative. During the run of the exhibition, Ruppersberg will periodically respond to these arrangements by reorganizing the items himself, thus creating a visual conversation with his audience  co-producers. \nThe exhibition also includes a selection of earlier collages and drawings-two-dimensional works from important series鑱絋he Gift and the Inheritance?1989), and鑱紺over Art?1985); both of which provide an historical backdrop to the new installations.\nRuppersberg s work is held in major collections including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.鑱紿e was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and lives and works in Los Angeles and New York.\nAllen Ruppersberg: You and Me or The Art of Give and Take鑱絠s organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Guest curator of the exhibition is Constance Lewallen, Adjunct Curator at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.\nThe publication that accompanies the exhibition was conceived by Ruppersberg as an artwork in itself, and is a cross between a traditional catalog and an artist s book. Based on a 1956 edition of travel guideThe Guest Informant,鑱絠t is spiral-bound and cardboard-covered. The publication contains essays by renowned author and cultural critic, Greil Marcus, and guest curator Constance Lewallen, along with an interview with and commentary on the artist, random ephemera, and exhibition information. It is co-published by JRP|Ringier, Switzerland. The new vinyl LP record will also be available in a limited edition of 200.\nMajor support for the exhibition and publication is provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional funding is provided by LLWW Foundation, the Frederick R. Weisman Philanthropic Foundation, the Pasadena Art Alliance, and Margo Leavin Gallery. Related programming is made possible in part by a grant from the City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Arts Commission, Emily Fisher Landau, Lenore and Bernard Greenberg, and Judy and Stuart Spence.\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/3718/,752e29977c85

While Hendricks has worked in a variety of media throughout his career, and has explored diverse subject matter, he is best known for his striking and provocative life-sized portraits of everyday African-American people from the urban northeast. Bringing to mind American realism, pop culture, and post-modernism in a way uniquely his own, Hendricks  pioneering contributions to African-American portraiture and conceptualism claims a compelling space somewhere between portraitists Chuck Close and Alex Katz, and African-American conceptualists David Hammons and Adrian Piper. At times cool, at times confrontational, sometimes sexually charged, and always empowering, the work reveals the artist s keen eye for his subject s attire, attitude, style, and point of view. Hendricks  groundbreaking body of work has both influenced and paved the way for many of today s generation of artists.\nHendricks calls his camera his  mechanical sketchbook,  as many of his paintings are realized from photographs of people he encountered in daily life.\nBirth of the Cool鑱絠s organized by Trevor Schoonmaker, Curator of Contemporary Art at the鑱絟ttp://www.nasher.duke.edu/exhibitions_hendricks.php鑱絠n Durham, North Carolina.\nThe exhibition catalog includes essays by Schoonmaker; Thelma Golden, Director and Chief Curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem; and Franklin Sirmans, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Menil Collection.\nFollowing its presentation at SMMoA, the exhibition will travel to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston.

With a fresh and vivid palette, a reductive, cartoon-like figurative style with a metallic-like patina reminiscent of video game robots and characters, Kelly creates scenes that on closer inspection reveal a mixture of personal archetypes and classic racial stereotypes.\nThe artist s aesthetic includes references to the figurative work of Jacob Lawrence and to the controversial stop motion animations of George Pal, especially鑱絁ohn Henry and the Inky-Poo鑱絘nd the鑱絁asperseries from the 1940s. Like Pal, Kelly utilizes the perception of race as a narrative device, something to work with and work against in the children s formation of identity through play.\nKelly was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1980 and grew up in Arlington, Texas. He received his B.F.A. in Painting from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and his M.F.A. from Yale University.

Don t Tread on Me,Jeni Spota,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"In her first West Coast museum exhibition, Jeni Spota brings contemporary elements to classical themes in her paintings, exploring traditional, often religious, imagery, in a new way. Through her small canvases, the viewer is able to peer into another world, watching epic scenes play out with a surreal, impressionistic twist.\nIn this exhibition, which includes new work, Spota fills her canvases with cramped figures engaged in frenzied activity, complete with choruses of angels, rows of haloed figures, and the Virgin floating, often repeatedly, in a mandorla, creating a heavy, purposeful yet intimate connection with the viewer that is rarely found in the Medieval and Renaissance pieces that her works recall. Other canvases are more abstract in their subject matter, as if she has cut and pasted detailed elements from her works to form a new composite. Don t Tread on Me features a new bronze cast of her paintings, perfectly underscoring Spota s attention to the construction of both narrative and surface.\nAdopting the flattened pictorial space of medieval icons combined with the rich, globular application of paint, Spota creates an ecstatic, almost abstract surface through her brushstroke technique, in which paint is heaped on in indulgent, cake frosting-like daubs and layers.\nSpota was born in New York and earned her B.F.A. at State University of New York at Purchase and her M.F.A. from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

Coming Attractions,Arnold Mesches,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"Arnold Mesches has created unabashedly figurative work for more than six decades and has emerged as a seminal figure in American painting and a remarkably fresh voice in contemporary art. In the West Coast debut of new paintings that explore the American condition,鑱紸rnold Mesches: Coming Attractions鑱給pens at the Santa Monica Museum of Art on January 24 and will be on view through April 18, 2009.\nMesches  most recent work delves into dark periods of American history and situates them in a hauntingly contemporary landscape. His work combines an interest in twentieth century political and social conflicts with a surrealist approach to painting?offsetting frank, historical moments with rich, melodramatic dreamscapes.\nThis new exhibition of Mesches  work, curated by Lisa Melandri, SMMoA s Deputy Director for Exhibitions and Programs, and uniquely installed in two Project Rooms, will feature selections from his most recent series, including landscapes and interiors. Aptly titled,鑱紺oming Attractions鑱絘lludes to the works  theatrical elements, as well as to a portent of what might be to come.\nMesches  large-scale interiors and landscape canvases, are laden with acerbic colors and vigorous brushwork. In his interiors, Mesches fills opulent concert halls and antique salons with stark reminders of social and political realities, rendered in deep blacks, austere whites, and sickly greens against the blazing colors of their surroundings. Mesches  landscapes are similarly harrowing, depicting glimpses of human existence between the trunks of decaying trees. These canvases are portraits of a disturbing, looming future, both absurd and poignant, as well as emotionally authentic.\nThe theatricality and grandeur of the paintings evoke Mesches  own history working in the movie industry during the 1940s and 50s in Los Angeles, and their skepticism and ominous sensibility harkens back to the 27 years he was subject to heavy scrutiny by the FBI for his participation in peace marches and demonstrations against McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Mesches eventually obtained his 760-page FBI file through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and turned dozens of the documents crisply typed white pages thick with black bars, dating from 1945 to 1972 into a popular and critically acclaimed art exhibition,鑱絋he FBI Files.\nThroughout his 60-plus-year career as an artist, Mesches has woven many narratives into lush and virtuosic paintings, and in鑱紺oming Attractions鑱組esches affirms that he is as potent as a painter and storyteller as ever. His life s work serves as a remarkable record of one artist s struggle to come to terms with the turmoil of the twentieth century. He has stood staunchly for using contemporary art as a vehicle for protest, a visual amplifier of societal good and evil.\nComing Attractions鑱絘lso marks a homecoming for Mesches, who was born in the Bronx, grew up in Buffalo, New York, and moved to Los Angeles in 1943 to accept a scholarship at the Art Center School (now Art Center College of Design). Mesches spent nearly half his life in L.A., and came into his own here in the mid 1940s and into the 50s, becoming known and revered for his socially critical paintings and his portraits. He now resides in Gainesville, Florida. He is the recipient of many awards, including the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2002).\nMesches has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and abroad in 125 solo exhibitions and countless group shows, and his works are included in many prestigious public and private collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Albright-Knox Museum, and the High Museum of Art. However, Mesches has still not received the global recognition or broad appreciation he so deserves for his influence and importance to the canon of contemporary art. As an antidote to this oversight, SMMoA will install Mesches  work in two Project Rooms, doubling the museum space normally allotted to such exhibitions.\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/arnold-mesches-coming-attractions-audio/,edd6d9177d15
"Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart",Elias Sime,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"From January 24 to April 18, 2009, the Santa Monica Museum of Art presents鑱紼lias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart, the first survey exhibition in the United States of one of Ethiopia s most original and prolific contemporary artists. The exhibition, co-curated by Meskerem Assegued, a revered Ethiopian curator and anthropologist, and visionary theater, opera, and multi-disciplinary arts impresario, Peter Sellars, is comprised of more than 100 works in a variety of mediums, scale, and forms. A highlight of the exhibition is a series of striking thrones made of leather, wood, mud and straw, which will be integrated into conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen s final Los Angeles Philharmonic concerts staged by Sellars in mid-April.\nElias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart鑱絯ill be accompanied by a film by award-winning filmmakers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) that will uniquely document the exhibition.\nUsing yarn, plastics, tattered fabric, buttons, used plastic, and bottle tops, each of the collages and stitched canvases Sime creates for鑱紼lias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart鑱絩epresent a complete essay about the current state of his surroundings. Sime s three-dimensional sculptures are made with traditional organic Ethiopian building materials such as mud and straw, as well as wood, metal, and other found objects, gathered in part by neighborhood children.\nIt was Sellars  passion for Sime s work that initially inspired SMMoA s executive director Elsa Longhauser to consider the idea of an exhibition of Sime s work. During their conversations, Sellars explained that Sime s thrones, designed to elevate and celebrate Ethiopia s street culture, so moved him that he was determined to feature the thrones in his production of Stravinsky s鑱絆edipus Rex鑱絘nd鑱絊ymphony of Psalms, Salonen s final concerts on April 16, 17, 18 and 19. Sime originally designed the thrones for Sellars  2006 New Crowned Hope Festival, a celebration of Mozart s 250th anniversary in Vienna, Austria.\nIn鑱紼lias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart, the thrones make up part of the installation piece鑱組in Neber, a new iteration of a series of works in which Sime addresses the dignity, wisdom and depth of the ancient indigenous cultures that are rapidly disappearing from Ethiopia. Also, displayed in a semicircle around a small ceremonial table, the installation will include five wall sculptures, made from wood, cans, leather, and stitches, as well as a short, silent video installation documenting indigenous religious practices of small villages in Ethiopia. In鑱組ud and Straw, small mud and straw creatures take over the gallery space. A video installation documents Sime s construction of a Gota, the traditional grain storage container found in northern Ethiopia.\nBIOGRAPHIES:\nAs a child, Elias Sime taught himself to sew, embroider, and repair furniture. He collected cast-off objects and materials, such as flattened tin cans, and fashioned them into his own creations. Today Sime still collects energetically plastic shopping bags in different colors, plastic shoes, horns from slaughtered cattle and buys some of the raw material for his work, such as buttons, at the Mercato, Addis Abeba s sprawling central market. Just as he gathers materials for making art from the markets and streets, Sim?finds the themes for his works in the streets of Addis. He documents the lives and portraits of Ethiopians living in the Cherkos Gebeya, Legaehar and Chide Terra areas surrounding Addis Abeba, where he finds most of his working materials. Sime has deep connections with the communities he documents, in particular with the neighborhood children who bring him objects they collect from the street.\nBorn in Cherkos, outside of Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, Sime graduated from Addis Abeba University s School of Fine Art and Design with a degree in graphic design. His practice focuses mainly on collages, stitches, and three-dimensional sculpture. Sime has had numerous solo shows, and has participated in many group exhibitions including the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Peter Sellars  New Crowned Hope in Vienna, Austria; the Dak Art Biennale 2004, in Dakar, Senegal; and the Zoma Contemporary Art Center and the National Museum in Addis Ababa. Sim?lives and works in Addis Ababa.\nPeter Sellars, a director of opera, theatre and film, is renowned worldwide for his innovative treatments of classical material from western and non-western traditions, and for exploring the role of the performing arts in contemporary society and his commitment to spreading artistic vision to enact change. He has served as artistic director of the Los Angeles Festival, the American National Theatre at the Kennedy Center, the Boston Shakespeare Company and the Elitch Theatre for Children in Denver. Sellars is a professor in the department of World Arts and Cultures at UCLA, where he teaches Art as Social Action and Art as Moral Action. His past teaching positions include a visiting professorship at the Center for Theatre Arts at UC Berkeley. He resides in Los Angeles.\nTrained as an anthropologist, Meskerem Assegued is the curator and founder of Addis Abeba s Zoma Contemporary Art Center. In 2006, she curated Green Flame in Vienna, Austria, part of the New Crowned Hope Festival, in which Sime participated. Assegued has served as a selection committee of the 2004 Dak Art Biennale, one of the largest contemporary art exhibitions in the world. In 2007, Assegued was on the selection committee for the African Pavilion in the 52nd Venice Biennale.

Heavyweight Champion,Martin Kersels,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png," I m not a photographer. I m an artist who uses photography when the idea dictates. And I think that s okay because I m also a performance artist who makes objects, or I m an object-maker who does performances. I think these labels are less important than the ability to go in the directions I d like for each work. \n- Martin Kersels in conversation with Ian Berry, Associate Director, The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College\nFrom September 13 to December 13, 2008, Santa Monica Museum of Art presents鑱組artin Kersels: Heavyweight Champion, the first retrospective of this influential and pioneering Southern California artist. Spanning the years from 1994 to 2007, the exhibition includes thirty-three multimedia artworks ranging from small sculptures, to large-scale photographs, to monumental installations. Kersels has long been esteemed in Southern California artistic and academic circles, and his work is in many collections worldwide. The advent of鑱紿eavyweight Champion鑱絤arks a timely opportunity for this 2008 Guggenheim Foundation Fellow to enjoy the broader recognition and respect his work and creative achievements so well deserve.\nKersels is a long-time aficionado of Buster Keaton, and on first encounter, his artwork seems to exude a similar deadpan slapstick style, balancing the humorous with the wistfully awkward. On further study, this initial impression gives way to darker layers; the performances and works reveal what Kersels refers to as  wink-wink humor mixed with a tragic element.  Early pieces, including the large-scale photographic series of Kersels falling, tripping, tossing people, and being smacked with assorted objects, find the artist experimenting with the creative possibilities of his 6-foot, 7-inch, 350 lb. frame. But the trajectory of Kersels  career as illuminated in鑱紿eavyweight Champion鑱絚learly indicates that he is not a single-issue artist; he is not, in the words of Ian Berry  the body-issue guy.  Particularly in his later work, the artist has gone in more conceptual directions, to explore themes of scale, time, space, sound, and gravity.\nHighlights of鑱紿eavyweight Champion鑱絠nclude the monumental installation鑱紻ionysian Stage?2004-2005), a 14-foot-diameter nest that spins like an enormous, natural disco ball, and incorporates all manner of homey, domestic debris in its woven willow branches. The work evolved from Kersels  interest in utilizing traditional craft in nontraditional ways, and from his study in Sweden and Denmark with master craftspeople.鑱絉ickety?2007), the artist s latest work, is a sculpture that compresses and oppresses furniture and other oversized objects beneath a platform. This lower, slightly topsy-turvy world stands in sharp contrast to the clean openness of the top part of the installation. While some of the other sculptures in the exhibition act as surrogates for Kersels  physical being,鑱絉ickety鑱絠s about the experience of the trials and tribulations of navigating a large body through the world.\nAn engaging range of programming accompanies鑱紿eavyweight Champion, beginning with a performance by the electrifying jazz/punk/blues band Puttanesca on Friday, September 12, the opening night of the exhibition. The concert will take place atop鑱絉ickety. Puttanesca s charismatic vocalist Weba Garretson was, along with Kersels, a member of the performance troupe SHRIMPS, which played a pivotal role in Kersels  development as an artist. Subsequent programming includes鑱紿eavyweight Lecture Musicale(Tuesday, September 23), Kersels  discussion of his work utilizing visual materials, songs, music, and dance, followed by a Q A with the artist; and the dance recital鑱紿uh?, choreographed by Melinda Ring specifically for the exhibition, and performed throughout鑱絉ickety?Friday and Saturday, November 14 and 15).\nHeavyweight Champion鑱絠s accompanied by a full-color catalog illustrating the scope of the artist s work. The publication includes an interview with Martin Kersels by Ian Berry, Associate Director at The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College, where the exhibition debuted.\n								",https://smmoa.org/video/huh-by-melinda-ring-at-smmoa/,aad3db1dba06

Judgment Modification (After Memling),Brody Condon,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"For鑱絁udgment Modification (After Memling), Brody Condon recreated鑱絋he Last Judgment鑱絙y Hans Memling (1467-71) in current computer game visual styles. While Condon s previous work was characterized by the subversive tactics of hacking and the intervention into commercial computer games,鑱絁udgment Modification鑱絩evealed his shift to composing projected moving-image installations that function as animated paintings. These noninteractive  self-playing  games run continuously, like games waiting for the viewer to pick up the controller.\nCondon s creative process is informed by the software hacking logic he learned directly from online and offline fan subcultures. In his work he often reinterprets historical events and existing artworks. Examples of this include a two-hour  Deathmatch  battle between medieval reenactors (Untitled War,?004) at Machine Project; and a computer simulation of the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, featuring an AK47-wielding David Koresh (Waco Resurrection,?003, a C-level collaboration). Trained as a sculptor, Condon uses technology as the raw material for his art, creating works that are both profound and playful.\nCondon lived for a number of years in the Netherlands, where he had easy access to 15th-century European religious paintings. He believes that these works influence the visual style of games and fantasy art. He also believes that the catastrophic thinking these works reflect has greatly influenced the current political discourse.  The references to monsters and wars, the emergence of readings of the Bible, the distrust of science, the faith in religious structures to solve our problems, this type of pre-modern thinking is rooted in the late-Medieval period in northern Europe,  notes Condon.\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/brody-condon-judgement-modification-after-memling-audio/,fd98ce8c91b0
Black Magic Woman,Loren Holland,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"Loren Holland s paintings lampoon assumptions about African American women. Her subjects are purposefully stylized to call attention to the way their real-life counterparts have been portrayed in the popular media as mysterious, exotic, sexual, even animalistic beings. Its title inspired by the Santana song of the same name,鑱紹lack Magic Woman鑱絛epicted three contemporary Santeria priestesses practicing in a spooky landscape filled with creeping mist. As with traditional representations of saints, each was surrounded by attributes. One, situated in a graveyard, conjured zombies with a nail-punctured human heart, poison from a blowfish, and the miraculous little blue pills that aid in raising the dead. Another, adopting the posture of someone who constantly works on a car in the street, turned her junker into a flourishing witch s garden. The last stood at her vanity, casting spells and hoping to capture the one she loves with the help of a voodoo doll, perfume, and face powder a combination of Chanel and Hershey s Cocoa. In all three cases, Holland fashioned images of creative, resourceful women whose magic is a metaphor for using everyday materials to make the proverbial silk purse from a sow s ear. Her lush and detailed figurative paintings are simultaneously literal and allegorical; they combine the eerie quality of nineteenth-century ghost stories with the visual language of a hip-hop music video. Black Magic Woman also alluded to a theatrical stage set, calling further attention to the artificial construction of the stereotypes it portrayed.\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/project-room-loren-holland-black-magic-woman-audio/,3d41df465019
The Wood,Sharon Levy,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"Sharon Levy s interest in the sublime qualities of the forest and in wood as a medium has led her to craft sculptures of trees in various stages of life and death. For鑱絋he Wood, Levy created a site-specific installation   a poignant fairytale forest evoking wonder, surprise, and pathos.鑱紺ookie, the centerpiece of the installation, appeared to be sliced from a giant tree. Made from two canvases stretched on a circular frame, surrounded by foam rubber painted to resemble bark,鑱紺ookie鑱絫owered at nine feet in diameter, dwarfing the viewer.鑱紺ookie s鑱絧ainstakingly painted growth rings represented both the tree s age and the duration of the artist s process.鑱絋he Wood鑱絘lso included鑱結oung Pines, two clusters of tree silhouettes with articulated branches jigsaw-cut from pine plywood: a manufactured material returning to its original form. Levy built many of her trees using construction techniques borrowed from theater props, tents, toys, and  knock-down  furniture; she delights in the irony inherent in creating portable, artificial props to represent such venerable natural objects.\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/project-room-1-sharon-levy-the-wood-audio/,b1d30a9f15dd
Between Science and Magic,Diana Thater,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Greg-PresentsJosephine-Greg.jpg,"Working in film, video, and installation, Diana Thater has been an innovator in her medium for 20 years and is best known for creating complex visual and spatial environments. Between Science and Magic is a simple, and beautiful, interpretation of  movie magic -a century-old expression that still conjures the mythology of Hollywood filmmaking. Thater s project is conceived as a brief history of cinema.\nThater s new and innovatory piece recreates, and repositions, a seminal moment in Los Angeles history, when downtown LA was being dreamed into a gilded metropolis and a theater district was built to rival New York s Great White Way. Renowned magician Greg Wilson appears as if filmed within the famed Los Angeles Theatre, the most elaborate of the movie palaces built between 1911 and 1931 on Los Angeles s now-defunct  theater row.  Thus, the viewer experiences a palpable tension between past and present. The repeated performance of an archetypal magic trick-pulling a rabbit out of a hat-is captured in tones of black, white, and grey; only the magician s skin tone and the rabbit s eyes have a trace of color.\nA pioneering filmmaker, Thater s work is held in many public collections including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate, London; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She has been the subject of solo exhibitions at such prestigious institutions as the Vienna Secession; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Kunsthalle Basel; and The Renaissance Society, Chicago. Most recently, Thater s gorillagorillagorilla-a poignant study of human and animal behavior-was premiered at the Kunsthaus Graz, in collaboration with the Museum of Natural History in London, to celebrate the bicentenary of Charles Darwin s birth. Between Science and Magic is Thater s first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in over 10 years.\nSupport for the exhibition is generously provided by The Broad Art Foundation, The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation, and The Suzanne Nora Johnson and David Gordon Johnson Foundation.\n \nRelated Links:\n\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/diana-thater-between-science-and-magic/,9c3406303772
"Birth of the Cool, Paintings 1964-2007",Barkley I. Hendricks,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"The renowned artist s first career retrospective highlights his paintings from 1964 to 2007. While Hendricks has worked in a variety of media throughout his career, and has explored diverse subject matter, he is best known for his striking and provocative life-sized portraits of everyday African-American people from the urban northeast. Bringing to mind American realism, pop culture, and post-modernism in a way uniquely his own, Hendricks  pioneering contributions to African-American portraiture and conceptualism claims a compelling space somewhere between portraitists Chuck Close and Alex Katz, and African-American conceptualists David Hammons and Adrian Piper. At times cool, at times confrontational, sometimes sexually charged, and always empowering, the work reveals the artist s keen eye for his subject s attire, attitude, style, and point of view. Hendricks  groundbreaking body of work has both influenced and paved the way for many of today s generation of artists.\nHendricks calls his camera his  mechanical sketchbook,  as many of his paintings are realized from photographs of people he encountered in daily life.\nBirth of the Cool鑱絠s organized by Trevor Schoonmaker, Curator of Contemporary Art at the鑱絟ttp://www.nasher.duke.edu/exhibitions_hendricks.php Nasher Museum of Art鑱絠n Durham, North Carolina.\nThe exhibition catalog includes essays by Schoonmaker; Thelma Golden, Director and Chief Curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem; and Franklin Sirmans, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Menil Collection.\nFollowing its presentation at SMMoA, the exhibition will travel to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston.

The exhibition featured more than fifty works by twenty of Tijuana s most important contemporary artists, architects, designers, and filmmakers. Their bold, cutting-edge work embodied the powerful creative energy of a city transformed by crosscurrents of globalization, media, and issues of migration and identity.\nWhether as the subject or the actual physical source of the materials used to create works of art, the City of Tijuana was at the core of everything in鑱絊trange New World/Extra甯給 Nuevo Mundo, which鑱絛iscovered new visual, verbal, and audio forms to manifest their experience of the rapidly changing interconnected realities of the local urban and global environments.\nStrange New World/Extra甯給 Nuevo Mundo, organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, featured the art of Mely Barrag璋﹏, Bulbo, Alida Cervantes, Enrique Ciapara, Hugo Crosthwaite, Teddy Cruz, Einar and Jamex de la Torre, Salom璐竛 Huerta, Ana Machado, Julio C鑼卻ar Morales, Julio Orozco, Ren?Peralta, Marcos Ram閾唕ez ERRE, Salvador V.

Wallace Berman   His Circle,Semina Culture,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"A key artist of his generation, Wallace Berman (1938-1976) was an enigmatic, underground figure whose collages and assemblages articulate an important strand of dark mysticism in post-War American culture. Berman s hand-printed, personally distributed literary journal, Semina (1955-1964) stands as an iconic document of its time. The first major museum exhibition to examine the significance of the charismatic Wallace Berman, Semina Culture: Wallace Berman   His Circle featured the complete loose-leaf run of Semina, as well as artworks, photographs, and publications by forty-nine artists that manifest the scope and interests of the new  Semina Culture.  More than seventy photographic portraits from Berman s archive were also shown for the first time, revealing the close-knit nature of this underground community.\nThese participants in an important emerging counterculture, the Beat movement of the 1950s and 1960s, pursued an alternative way of thinking about the purpose and formal nature of art, infusing their works with nostalgia, lyricism, feeling, and a sense of the ephemeral. They include Robert Alexander, John Altoon, Toni Basil, Paul Beattie, Ray and Bonnie Bremser, Charles Brittin, Joan Brown, Cameron, Bruce Conner, Jean Conner, Jay DeFeo, Diane DiPrima, Kirby Doyle, Bobby Driscoll, Robert Duncan, Joe Dunn, Llyn Foulkes, Loree Foxx, Ralph Gibson, Allen Ginsberg, Billy Gray, George Herms, Jack Hirschman, Dennis Hopper, Billy Jahrmarkt, Jess, Lawrence Jordan, Patricia Jordan, Bob Kaufman, Philip Lamantia, William Margolis, Michael McClure, Taylor Mead, David Meltzer, Henry Miller, Stuart Perkoff, John Reed, Arthur Richer, Rachel Rosenthal, Jack Smith, Dean Stockwell, Ben Talbert, Russel Tamblyn, Aya (Tarlow), Edmund Teske, Zack Walsh, Lew Welch, and John Wieners. For these iconoclasts, art was a joyful and creative expression, not a means to an artworld career. Their approach to the purpose and formal nature of art and culture existed on a vastly different track from the canonical traditions of abstract expressionism, minimalism, and postmodernism.\nGuest-curated by Michael Duncan and Kristine McKenna, Semina Culture traveled to the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art, Utah State University, Logan, Utah (January 10   March 15, 2006); the Ulrich Museum of Art, Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas (April 21   July 9, 2006); the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum   Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley, California (October 17   December 10, 2006); and The Grey Art Gallery, New York University, New York, New York (January 16   March 31, 2007).\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/beat-thing/,2ba31da722ba
Concordance,Alfred Jensen,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"Although Alfred Jensen s work had been examined in major international exhibitions, Concordance, an exhibition of selected major paintings from 1960 to 1980, represented the artist s first comprehensive solo exhibition in Los Angeles. Active since the early 1950s, Jensen discovered his mature artistic voice in 1960, after repudiating abstract expressionist form and color in favor of an art based exclusively on the diagram. In such key works as Cycle Ending, Per I-V (1960) and Parthenon (1962), Jensen developed the parameters of a vision that would define his work over the next twenty years: signs from Mayan calendrical and numerical systems, palette from Goethian color theory, and patterns echoing Guatemala s landscape, architecture, and textiles. Concordance was organized by Dia Center for the Arts curator Lynne Cooke.\n								",https://smmoa.org/audio/alfred-jensen-concordance-2/,351fadf5847b
Miracle Half Mile,Stephen Keene,https://smmoa.org/wp-content/themes/smmoa/images/smmoa-print-template-logo.png,"Using an assembly-line, performance-based painting style, Keene produced more than 10,000 works of art for this exhibition, including benches, lanterns, and tablecloths, as well as paintings. He also set up a studio inside the Museum to let people view the performance of his painting. Keene chose images of works from catalogs of Los Angeles art collections and then duplicated them simultaneously on thirty or forty plywood boards he had set up around the gallery. The paintings were hung throughout the museum salon-style, then sold for prices ranging from $3 to $25. Keene compares his paintings to souvenirs, trading cards, and music CDs:  It s art, it s cheap, and it changes your life, but the object has no status.  This was Keene s largest show to date and his first exhibition on the West Coast.\n								",https://smmoa.org/video/stephen-keenes-art-marathon-at-smmoa/,c9c3a25e8b5b
