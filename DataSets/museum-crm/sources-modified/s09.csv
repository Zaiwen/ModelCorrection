Estelle Ishigo,"Estelle Ishigo is probably best known as the chronicler in art of the Wyoming Heart Mountain Concentration Camp experience.  Of English, Dutch and French ancestry, Ishigo was married to a nisei and spent most of her life among Japanese Americans.  Estelle Peck was born in Oakland in 1899 and moved with her family to Los Angeles at the age of 12.  A sympathetic teacher noted her interest in art and directed her to Otis Art Institute, where she found her calling and met Arthur Ishigo (1902-1957), a San Francisco-born Nisei who was working as a chauffeur for California Lieutenant Governor Robert Kenny.  Antimiscegenation laws at the time prohibited interracial couples from getting married, so in 1928, Peck and Ishigo took a trip across the border to Tijuana to be wed.  Hoping for a career as an actor, Arthur worked as a janitor at Paramount Studios while Estelle worked as an art teacher.  Shunned by her family and by other Caucasians, the couple lived among the Japanese American community.With the outbreak of World War II and the removal of all West Coast Japanese Americans to inland concentration camps, the couple faced a dilemma.  As a Nisei, Arthur was required to go while his wife was not.  Though he wanted her to stay behind, she accompanied her husband first to the Pomona ""Assembly Center"" in California, then to Heart Mountain, Wyoming.  Throughout the war years, Estelle drew, sketched and painted what she saw, providing a valuable document of life in the American concentration camps.  ""Strange as it may sound, in this desolate, lonely place I felt accepted for the first time in my life,"" she later wrote of her time at Heart Mountain.  She and her husband remained there in order to record the last days of the camp until the camp closed.  They and the others who were left were given $25 and put on a train to the West Coast.  ""I felt as if I were part of a defeated Indian tribe,"" she remembered. The couple lived for several years in poverty in a succession of trailer parks until Arthur got a job as a baggage handler at an airport.  After Arthur died of cancer  in 1957, Estelle took a job as a mimeograph operator to make ends meet.  In 1984, fellow Heart Mountain inmate Bacon Sakatani found Ishigo living in dire poverty in a squalid apartment, both her legs lost to gangrene.  Former Heart Mountain residents made her last years pleasant ones and oversaw the republication of her 1972 book of drawings, Lone Heart Mountain.  In 1990, film maker Steven Okazaki made a documentary of her life titled Days of Waiting.  She passed away before seeing the film, which went on to win an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.",1899,1990,5a56762fc4f8
Hideo Date,"New York City-based artist Hideo Date (1907-2004) was born in Osaka, Japan and immigrated to California in 1923.  After graduating from high school he enrolled at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, but left after a year to pursue the study of traditional brush painting in Japan.  Date returned to Los Angeles where he spent the 1930s immersed in the burgeoning Los Angeles art scene.  He interacted and exhibited with a host of other young artists through groups such as the College Art Association, the Foundation of Western Art, the Los Angeles Oriental Artists Group, and the Los Angeles Art Association.  Date was greatly influenced by artist and teacher Stanton MacDonald-Wright who oversaw the Los Angeles Art Students League.  Date was also a part of the Independents, a group of L.A.-based artists who rejected the tenets of modernism.With the outbreak of World War II, Date was sent first to the Santa Anita Race Track, California and then to Heart Mountain concentration camp in Wyoming, where he taught art privately to other Japanese American inmates.  He went to New York City after the war and continued to involve himself with other artists and associations.  He traveled extensively, going to New Orleans and back to Los Angeles, and then to Italy and France.Date's body of work is important to an understanding of Japanese American history, particularly in terms of looking at the changes over time from the early prewar period through to the present day.  Date is additionally important because of his issei status, shedding light on the immigrant generation and the role of artists in the prewar era.",1907,2004,472bb6532d74
Henry Sugimoto,"Henry Sugimoto (1900-1990) was born in Gozenmatsu, Wakayama prefecture, Japan and immigrated to the United States in 1919 after he finished his studies at Wakayama Middle School.  Sugimoto traveled to Hanford, California, joining his parents who had immigrated years earlier.  He graduated from Hanford High School and attended the University of California at Berkeley, the California College of Arts and Crafts, the California School of Fine Art, and the Academie Colarossi in Paris, France.  He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from California College of Arts and Crafts in 1928.After completing his studies, Sugimoto taught art and Japanese language for a living.  He also traveled to France and Mexico to develop and hone his art.  His work was exhibited a the Salon d'Automne in Paris, the California Palace of Legion of Honor, and the San Francisco Museum of Art.  With the outbreak of World War II, Sugimoto and his family were forcibly removed from Hanford to the Fresno Assembly Center, California and then transported to the concentration camps at Jerome and later Rohwer, Arkansas, where he taught high school art classes.  After the war, the family resettled in New York City where he worked as an artist and a fabric designer.Sugimoto has received numerous awards.  His painting have been exhibited in many public and private galleries in the United States, Europe and Japan.  During the 1980s, both the Smithsonian and the Wakayama Modern Art Museum acquired some of Sugimoto's paintings for their permanent collection.Though his paintings encompass many styles and subjects, Sugimoto is best known for his depictions of the World War II concentration camps.  These emotionally charged works reveal many aspects of the Japanese American experience during World War II, conjuring the fear and trauma and other facets of life within the barbed wire fences.  Late in his life, Sugimoto also painted a series of canvases depicting the pre-World War II issei experience.",1901,1990,08f0bc5cc36c
Mori Shimada,"Moriyuki Shimada (1920-2000) was twenty-two years old when he and his family were forcibly removed from their home in Santa Clara, California to the Heart Mountain concentration camp in Wyoming.",1920,2000,49c7fbad6d87
George Hoshida,"George Hoshida (1907-1985) was born in Japan and at the age of five, his family settled in Hilo, Hawaii.  As an active practitioner of Judo, Hoshida was active at the local dojo.  This led directly to his arrest by FBI agents on the day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor as a potential saboteur.  Unlike most Japanese Americans living in Hawaii, Hoshida was incarcerated for the duration of the war, first at Kilauea Military Camp and Sand Island in Hawaii and later in mainland Justice Department internment camps at Lordsburg and Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Eventually, he was able to rejoin his wife and young daughters, but only when they agreed to leave Hawaii to be incarcerated with him in a War Relocation Authority camp on the mainland.  Hoshida began a visual diary of his incarceration from his earliest days in prison.  The two notebooks in the collection of the Japanese American National Museum are an extremely rare visual document of the special Justice Department camps and chart his frequent movement from one facility to the next.",1907,1985,71f60ee8b4d0
Hisako Hibi,"Hisako Hibi was born Hisako Shimizu in Torihama, Fukui prefecture located near the city of Kyoto, Japan.  In 1920, at the age of thirteen, she immigrated to the United States to rejoin her parents already living in San Francisco.  After a few years, Hibi's parents and siblings decided to return to Japan, but Hibi was determined to stay in the U.S. and continue her education. She graduated from Lowell High School in San Francisco.  In 1927, she decided to pursue her interest in art by enrolling at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) which she attended for three years.  Hibi studied primarily with Gottardo Piazzoni and was influenced by Cezanne and other Post-Impressionist painters.  It was also at the California School of Fine Arts that she met her future husband Matsusaburo George Hibi who was also an artist and teacher at the school.  They were married in the fall of 1930 and had two children, a son, Satoshi and a daughter, Ibuki.  Through the 1930s and 1940s, Hibi continued to paint and exhibit her work in the San Francisco Art Association Annuals, The California Artist Exhibition at the Golden Gate International Exposition and the California State Fair and Oakland Art Gallery.The Hibis were living in Hayward, California when Executive Order 9066 was issued and in May 1942 they were sent to the Tanforan Assembly Center in San Bruno, California.  The Assembly Center was a former horse race track and the Hibis, along with approximately 8,000 other Japanese Americans were forced to live in only slightly renovated horse stalls.  Among the internees were a number of accomplished, professional artists including the Hibis, Chiura Obata, Byron Takashi Tsuzuki, and Mine Okubo.  Under the leadership of Obata, they organized the Tanforan Art School within the first month of their arrival.  In September 1942, the internees of Tanforan were relocated further inland to the Topaz Concentration Camp in Utah.  The art school resumed its courses as a division of the Topaz Adult Education Program and set up an elaborate curriculum for its students ranging in age from six to over seventy years old.  Mrs. Hibi taught drawing and painting in oil and watercolors as well as clay modeling.  The Hibis were held in Topaz until the end of the war and the closing of the concentration camps.  In September 1945, the family relocated to New York City.  Tragically, in 1947, George Matsusaburo Hibi died.  Mrs. Hibi worked as a dressmaker to support herself and her two children.  She continued to paint and attended art classes at the Museum of Modern Art where she was influenced by Victor D'Amico.  In 1953, Hibi took advantage of the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, to officially become a United States citizen.  In 1954, Hibi decided to return to San Francisco where she supported herself by working as a housekeeper and dressmaker.  She studied with Ann O'Hanlon's Perception Workshop, University of California, Berkeley Extension Program and Sight and Insight.  Hibi was also a member of the Asian American Women Artists Association based in Northern California.  As a result of various influences and her individual growth as an artist, Hibi's painting style gradually changed in the post-war period.  Taking off from her initial impressionistic style of painting, Hibi went on to experiment with xpressionism and abstraction.   Since the 1960s, Hibi's paintings have been exhibited steadily from the in a number of group and one-woman shows.  She has also been recognized with various awards, including being selected Artist of the Year by the City Arts Council of San Francisco in 1985.  Hisako Hibi remained in San Francisco until her death in 1991.  Hisako Hibi painted 72 works while incarcerated at Tanforan and Topaz.  Currently one of these is in the collection of the Oakland Museum and another was given to the San Francisco Buddhist Church.  Another seven paintings are in a private collection.  In 1996 fifty-five paintings were donated to the Japanese American National Museum.  The remaining eight, initially thought to be missing, were located and added to the donation in 1998.<br>",1907,1991,aa6d02609e7a

Benji Okubo,"Born and raised in Riverside, California in 1904, Benji Okubo learned landscape design from his father and an appreciation of art from his mother, an accomplished calligrapher.  In 1928, he moved to Los Angeles to attend the Otis Art Institute where he won first prize in the California Botanical Gardens poster contest, among other honors.  While at Otis, Okubo began attending the Los Angeles Art Students League, where he became a student and later a colleague of Stanton MacDonald-Wright.  With artists Hideo Date, Tyrus Wong, and Gilbert Leung, Okubo organized the Oriental Artists Group of Los Angeles, which held exhibitions at museums throughout California, including the Los Angeles County Museum and the San Francisco Museum of Art. When MacDonald-Wright left to pursue other projects, Okubo became a co-leader of the Art Students League, helping shape the direction and style of its work until the on-set of World War II.  During this period, Okubo also created a set of murals with Tyrus Wong for Eddie See's Dragon's Den, a restaurant and club in Los Angeles' Chinatown popular among Chinese Americans, Los Angeles artists, and members of the Hollywood elite.In 1942, as part of the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans, Okubo was sent to the Pomona assembly center and then to the concentration camp at Heart Mountain where he and fellow artist Hideo Date mounted what researchers believe is the final exhibition of the influential Arts Students League.   While in camp Okubo continued to paint while teaching art to other inmates, including artist Estelle Ishigo.  He married Chisato Takashima in Wyoming and they returned together to Los Angeles after the closing of Heart Mountain in 1945.  Upon returning to California after the war, Okubo resumed his landscape architecture practice, the career he used to support his artistic endeavors over the years, designing gardens for prominent businesses and celebrities.  While Okubo continued to paint, his professional career in art did not resume its pre-war level of activity and recognition.  He died in Los Angeles on April 15, 1975.  His sister, Mine Okubo, was also a noted artist.  <br>",1904,1975,c1558ecb6b83
