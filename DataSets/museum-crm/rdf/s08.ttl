The works on view are in communication with one another portraits of Qusuquzah and Din gaze out at modernist interiors and plein-air landscapes, all confronted by the artist s arresting recreations of Courbet s Origin.nIn nineteenth-century visual culture, black female sexuality functioned as something to be rejected or disparaged, but Thomas reconfigures these historical tropes into contemporary statements of empowerment. By casting African American women as the  heroines  of her works, she makes a profound statement regarding gender and racial identity. Thomas s dialogue with Courbet and Duchamp is a strong reclamation of history, reasserting the subjective nature of beauty. In addition to her paintings and photographs, she will create an installation in SMMoA s Project Room 1, to reinvent鑱借劇tant Donn鑼卻, where the  peep show  reveals the true surprise of a 70s-style paneled interior in the place of Duchamp s splayed female body.nSome content may be deemed inappropriate for younger viewers.nMickalene Thomas was born in 1971.

Taking cues from Marcel Duchamp s鑱借劇tant Donn鑼卻: 1�?la chute d eau, 2�?le gaz d 鑼卌lairage�?Given: 1.鑱絋he Waterfall, 2.鑱絋he Illuminating Gas) and Gustave Courbet s L Origine du Monde (The Origin of the World), Thomas presents the female figure as the origin of the universe, focusing on how the female body both engenders and inhabits landscape. The works on view are in communication with one another portraits of Qusuquzah and Din gaze out at modernist interiors and plein-air landscapes, all confronted by the artist s arresting recreations of Courbet s Origin.nIn nineteenth-century visual culture, black female sexuality functioned as something to be rejected or disparaged, but Thomas reconfigures these historical tropes into contemporary statements of empowerment. By casting African American women as the  heroines  of her works, she makes a profound statement regarding gender and racial identity. Thomas s dialogue with Courbet and Duchamp is a strong reclamation of history, reasserting the subjective nature of beauty. In addition to her paintings and photographs, she will create an installation in SMMoA s Project Room 1, to reinvent鑱借劇tant Donn鑼卻, where the  peep show  reveals the true surprise of a 70s-style paneled interior in the place of Duchamp s splayed female body.nSome content may be deemed inappropriate for younger viewers.nMickalene Thomas was born in 1971. She earned a Bachelor s of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute and a Master s of Fine Arts from Yale University.

SMMoA Executive Director Elsa Longhauser and Deputy Director Lisa Melandri are co-curators for the exhibition.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman is part of Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980. This unprecedented collaboration, initiated by the Getty, brings together more than sixty cultural institutions from across Southern California for six months beginning October 2011 to tell the story of the birth of the L.A. art scene. An artist who worked on both the East and West coasts and bridged gaps between areas as disparate as New York Dada and Southern California ceramics, Wood (1893-1998) was a vital contributor to the art scene of the period and is thus a key player in the Pacific Standard Time project.nBeatrice Wood: Career Woman includes over 100 works of art. The exhibition begins with Wood s early Dada work, which includes drawings, paintings, posters, prints, and illustrated albums and travelogues. Wood first encountered Dada a primary creative and personal influence in New York, arising from her intimate friendships with Marcel Duchamp and the collectors Walter and Louise Arensberg. It was Dada that first inspired Wood to become an artist, and it shaped her creative thinking for the rest of her life. The exhibition also feature prominent examples of Wood s ceramics created from the 1940s until her death in 1998. Wood was exceptionally prolific, even given her remarkable longevity. She repeatedly investigated and revisited a number of subjects, forms, and materials over a 60- to 70-year period.nThough Wood did not turn to ceramics until 1933 at the age of 40, she became an accomplished clay artist and went on to produce some of her most notable works well into her 90s. Her experimentation with ceramic glazing and firing was extraordinary, a compendium of clay technique. She first began to experiment with clay pieces that took the form of tiles or plates. By the 1980s, Wood was creating objects on a much larger scale, such as colossal goblets more than a foot tall and wide. The exhibition will survey the full range of her ceramics from the miniature to the large-scale, from the utilitarian to the decorative, and from the vessel to figurative sculpture.nA fully-illustrated 144-page comprehensive catalog, published by the Santa Monica Museum of Art, accompanies the exhibition and offers a scholarly assessment of Beatrice Wood. This elegant publication includes 58 full-color plates, over 90 photographs, forward and acknowledgements by curators Elsa Longhauser and Lisa Melandri, original texts by Garth Clark, Kathleen Pyne and Jenni Sorkin, Wood s original diaries annotated and edited by Francis M. Naumann and Marie T. Keller, and a chronology by Lida M. Sunderland. The catalog s essays range from the examination of Wood s threshold position in early modernism, to her relationship with the Theosophical community in Ojai, as well as a technical evaluation of her work in clay. Wood began her life in art as a dilettante, and emerged a serious artist, nearly fifty years later. The accompanying writings illuminate the evolution of her work and document the art historical trajectory that delineates her vibrant contribution to the canon of Twentieth Century art.nWood created a complex, thoughtful, and inexhaustible oeuvre, one that is equal parts narrative and form, equal parts poetry and wit. Her irrepressible sensibility could be bold, audacious, insouciant, sexually charged, and at times biographical. This exhibition will honor Wood s indomitable spirit and dynamic artistic force, a pairing that produced a mature body of work that defines her importance as an artist.

The exhibition features two major series in Taylor s vast oeuvre: Wire Instruments (1989-1990) and Pet Stains (1989-1992). These distinctive bodies of work will illustrate the importance of Taylor s process and creative breadth.nTaylor was born in Springfield, Missouri in 1948. He studied at the Kansas City Art Institute and moved to New York in 1970, where he lived and worked until his death at the age of 51 from lung cancer in 1999. Taylor worked for many years as studio assistant to Robert Rauschenberg (where he met his future wife Debbie) and was acquainted with such burgeoning luminaries as James Rosenquist, Cy Twombly, and Brice Marden. Although these relationships nourished Taylor s abundant talent, his future work was inspired but not defined by these friendships. Out of financial necessity, he scavenged art materials from the street. His connection with the commonplace which remained unpredictable and deep resulted in a body of work that is singular, inventive, and eloquent.nTaylor began his studio practice as a painter in the seventies and early eighties. By 1985, however, he had developed a unique approach to process that encompassed a synergistic relationship between two-dimensional drawings and three-dimensional assemblages. Taylor s goal was to create a new way to experience and envision space; the works from this period helped him refine his investigations of visual perception across several dimensions.  Al felt that his work was research into vision,  says Debbie Taylor.  His work is really about looking, but he used everything around him. Seeing something could lead him to making one of these pieces, that could combine with something that he d read that morning, or with some music playing on the stereo, or with something on TV. Any of those things could inspire him. nTaylor made no distinction between his three-dimensional constructions and his drawings. Dismissing the term  sculpture,  he preferred to see the 3-D work as  drawing in space.  Fashioned from such simple elements as wooden broomsticks, wire, carpentry remnants, and other ephemera, his constructions offer a multitude of distinct points of view. Taylor s drawings, in fact, often inspired the development of his three-dimensional works, which he created as an extension, in order to  see more.  Taylor remarked that  [the work] isn t at all about sculptural concerns; it comes from a flatter set of traditions. What I am really after is finding a way to make a group of drawings that you can look around. Like a pool player, I want to have all the angles covered. nThe drawings and constructions titled Wire Instruments show Taylor experimenting with the simplest variations of geometric form (especially the triangle). These fragile ink, pencil, and gouache drawings and wood and wire constructions have not been the focus of any previous exhibitions or scholarly investigation. Their simplicity and ephemeral beauty provide a poignant glimpse into Taylor s creative production.nThe body of work called Pet Stains (which includes Pet Stains, Pet Names, Pet Stain Removal Devices, and the Peabody Group) portrays sensuous, abstract imagery of drop-like puddles, formulated with toner, paint, or ink on paper. The constructions in this series are made from wood and Plexiglas that is dribbled and dripped with paint of every viscosity. In this series, Taylor transformed patterns of dog urine on an urban sidewalk into art. The playful ease and subtle humor of these works is apparent: various pee-stains are often tagged with imaginary names of the dogs/artists who made them Buddy, Norman, Getty, Goya, and Everready or, with a nod to Duchamp, given such titles as Puddle Descending a Staircase, and so on. Again, as in Wire Instruments, permutation and variation on the theme is integral to his process how many pet names, how many puddles of pee can he transform into nuanced drawings or quirky constructions.nWire Instruments and Pet Stains will include 47 works.

The exhibition features two major series in Taylor s vast oeuvre: Wire Instruments (1989-1990) and Pet Stains (1989-1992). These distinctive bodies of work will illustrate the importance of Taylor s process and creative breadth.nTaylor was born in Springfield, Missouri in 1948. He studied at the Kansas City Art Institute and moved to New York in 1970, where he lived and worked until his death at the age of 51 from lung cancer in 1999. Taylor worked for many years as studio assistant to Robert Rauschenberg (where he met his future wife Debbie) and was acquainted with such burgeoning luminaries as James Rosenquist, Cy Twombly, and Brice Marden. Although these relationships nourished Taylor s abundant talent, his future work was inspired but not defined by these friendships. Out of financial necessity, he scavenged art materials from the street. His connection with the commonplace which remained unpredictable and deep resulted in a body of work that is singular, inventive, and eloquent.nTaylor began his studio practice as a painter in the seventies and early eighties. By 1985, however, he had developed a unique approach to process that encompassed a synergistic relationship between two-dimensional drawings and three-dimensional assemblages. Taylor s goal was to create a new way to experience and envision space; the works from this period helped him refine his investigations of visual perception across several dimensions.  Al felt that his work was research into vision,  says Debbie Taylor.  His work is really about looking, but he used everything around him. Seeing something could lead him to making one of these pieces, that could combine with something that he d read that morning, or with some music playing on the stereo, or with something on TV. Any of those things could inspire him. nTaylor made no distinction between his three-dimensional constructions and his drawings. Dismissing the term  sculpture,  he preferred to see the 3-D work as  drawing in space.  Fashioned from such simple elements as wooden broomsticks, wire, carpentry remnants, and other ephemera, his constructions offer a multitude of distinct points of view. Taylor s drawings, in fact, often inspired the development of his three-dimensional works, which he created as an extension, in order to  see more.  Taylor remarked that  [the work] isn t at all about sculptural concerns; it comes from a flatter set of traditions. What I am really after is finding a way to make a group of drawings that you can look around. Like a pool player, I want to have all the angles covered. nThe drawings and constructions titled Wire Instruments show Taylor experimenting with the simplest variations of geometric form (especially the triangle). These fragile ink, pencil, and gouache drawings and wood and wire constructions have not been the focus of any previous exhibitions or scholarly investigation. Their simplicity and ephemeral beauty provide a poignant glimpse into Taylor s creative production.nThe body of work called Pet Stains (which includes Pet Stains, Pet Names, Pet Stain Removal Devices, and the Peabody Group) portrays sensuous, abstract imagery of drop-like puddles, formulated with toner, paint, or ink on paper. The constructions in this series are made from wood and Plexiglas that is dribbled and dripped with paint of every viscosity. In this series, Taylor transformed patterns of dog urine on an urban sidewalk into art. The playful ease and subtle humor of these works is apparent: various pee-stains are often tagged with imaginary names of the dogs/artists who made them Buddy, Norman, Getty, Goya, and Everready or, with a nod to Duchamp, given such titles as Puddle Descending a Staircase, and so on. Again, as in Wire Instruments, permutation and variation on the theme is integral to his process how many pet names, how many puddles of pee can he transform into nuanced drawings or quirky constructions.nWire Instruments and Pet Stains will include 47 works. Connie Butler, The Robert Lehman Foundation Chief Curator of Drawings at the Museum of Modern Art, will contribute a major essay to accompany the exhibition.nMajor support for the exhibition is generously provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and The Audrey and Sydney Irmas Charitable Foundation.

Lord s work transforms sensation into physical form charged with emotion, reflection, physical identity, and personal history.nIn Lord s exhibition for SMMoA, elements from five series of works represent developments in his oeuvre from the 1990s to the present day. Breathing, biting, swallowing, tasting, smelling, listening, watching is a landmark series of forms (1992-1998) in which Lord transforms abstract sensation into material form by molding his own body into clay with repeated applications of his chest, teeth, neck, nostrils, ears and eyes. By using his body as a tool, he translates the senses hearing, seeing, tasting, feeling from their liminal states into tactile and visual objects. In another series round, modeling, marking, touching and holding, pressing and squeezing, palm, fist Lord explores the sculptural variations made by the actions and gestures of his hands.nIn untitled series (2004), Lord observes and rebuilds the ceramics of Paul Gauguin, who has been a pivotal influence for him since the 1970s. Lord s untitled series explores Gauguin s enigmatic narrative in clay, of figures emerging from a natural landscape or engaged in everyday activity.nMore recently in Whitworth (2009), Lord built a series of clay sculptures that record the monuments, landscapes and people of his birthplace Whitworth, in Lancashire, England. In these works he uses memory as a sense in itself, giving it three-dimensional form. By imbuing the act of remembering with corporeal potential, Lord creates a sculptural map of the town, navigating his personal history through the recognizable landmarks of Whitworth s geography. Lord is also creating river Spodden at Healey Dell, a new series of plaster and beeswax sculptures that depict abstracted elements of the river on its rocky course through Whitworth. A video of the same name, made in 2008, accompanies the sculptures.nLord studied at Rochdale College of Art, England and later at the Central School of Art and Design, London. His work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam; and The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA. Lord has had solo exhibitions at Galerie Art   Project, Amsterdam; The Carnegie Museum of Art; Camden Arts Centre, London; and Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Enschede. His work has been included in Westkunst-Heute at the Museen dr Stadt, K鏋歭n; the 1995 Whitney Biennial; Site and Insight at PS1, New York; and The Third Mind at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.nSMMoA is collaborating with Milton Keynes Gallery in England on the production of a major catalogue that features an interview between Lord and James Rondeau (Curator, Frances and Thomas Dittmer Chair of Contemporary Art, The Art Institute of Chicago), and an essay by independent curator and scholar, Linda Norden. The combined exhibitions at SMMoA and Milton Keynes Gallery will comprise a comprehensive survey of Lord s work.nThe exhibition curator for Andrew Lord: between my hands to water falling, selected works from 1990 to 2010 is Elsa Longhauser, SMMoA Executive Director.nMajor support is generously provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Abby Sher, the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation, and Gladstone Galleryn\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Lord s work transforms sensation into physical form charged with emotion, reflection, physical identity, and personal history.nIn Lord s exhibition for SMMoA, elements from five series of works represent developments in his oeuvre from the 1990s to the present day. Breathing, biting, swallowing, tasting, smelling, listening, watching is a landmark series of forms (1992-1998) in which Lord transforms abstract sensation into material form by molding his own body into clay with repeated applications of his chest, teeth, neck, nostrils, ears and eyes. By using his body as a tool, he translates the senses hearing, seeing, tasting, feeling from their liminal states into tactile and visual objects. In another series round, modeling, marking, touching and holding, pressing and squeezing, palm, fist Lord explores the sculptural variations made by the actions and gestures of his hands.nIn untitled series (2004), Lord observes and rebuilds the ceramics of Paul Gauguin, who has been a pivotal influence for him since the 1970s. Lord s untitled series explores Gauguin s enigmatic narrative in clay, of figures emerging from a natural landscape or engaged in everyday activity.nMore recently in Whitworth (2009), Lord built a series of clay sculptures that record the monuments, landscapes and people of his birthplace Whitworth, in Lancashire, England. In these works he uses memory as a sense in itself, giving it three-dimensional form. By imbuing the act of remembering with corporeal potential, Lord creates a sculptural map of the town, navigating his personal history through the recognizable landmarks of Whitworth s geography. Lord is also creating river Spodden at Healey Dell, a new series of plaster and beeswax sculptures that depict abstracted elements of the river on its rocky course through Whitworth. A video of the same name, made in 2008, accompanies the sculptures.nLord studied at Rochdale College of Art, England and later at the Central School of Art and Design, London. His work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam; and The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA. Lord has had solo exhibitions at Galerie Art   Project, Amsterdam; The Carnegie Museum of Art; Camden Arts Centre, London; and Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Enschede. His work has been included in Westkunst-Heute at the Museen dr Stadt, K鏋歭n; the 1995 Whitney Biennial; Site and Insight at PS1, New York; and The Third Mind at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.nSMMoA is collaborating with Milton Keynes Gallery in England on the production of a major catalogue that features an interview between Lord and James Rondeau (Curator, Frances and Thomas Dittmer Chair of Contemporary Art, The Art Institute of Chicago), and an essay by independent curator and scholar, Linda Norden. The combined exhibitions at SMMoA and Milton Keynes Gallery will comprise a comprehensive survey of Lord s work.nThe exhibition curator for Andrew Lord: between my hands to water falling, selected works from 1990 to 2010 is Elsa Longhauser, SMMoA Executive Director.nMajor support is generously provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Abby Sher, the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation, and Gladstone Galleryn\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Between Science and Magic is a simple, and beautiful, interpretation of  movie magic -a century-old expression that still conjures the mythology of Hollywood filmmaking. Thater s project is conceived as a brief history of cinema.nThater s new and innovatory piece recreates, and repositions, a seminal moment in Los Angeles history, when downtown LA was being dreamed into a gilded metropolis and a theater district was built to rival New York s Great White Way. Renowned magician Greg Wilson appears as if filmed within the famed Los Angeles Theatre, the most elaborate of the movie palaces built between 1911 and 1931 on Los Angeles s now-defunct  theater row.  Thus, the viewer experiences a palpable tension between past and present. The repeated performance of an archetypal magic trick-pulling a rabbit out of a hat-is captured in tones of black, white, and grey; only the magician s skin tone and the rabbit s eyes have a trace of color.nA pioneering filmmaker, Thater s work is held in many public collections including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate, London; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She has been the subject of solo exhibitions at such prestigious institutions as the Vienna Secession; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Kunsthalle Basel; and The Renaissance Society, Chicago. Most recently, Thater s gorillagorillagorilla-a poignant study of human and animal behavior-was premiered at the Kunsthaus Graz, in collaboration with the Museum of Natural History in London, to celebrate the bicentenary of Charles Darwin s birth.

Al is a  vernacular anthropologist  whose artistic interests and sensibilities have been indelibly shaped by the spirit and ethos of Southern California. nRuppersberg s vast oeuvre includes paintings, prints, photographs, sculptures, installations and books that explore the intersection of art, literature, and life. His work is often participatory, like that of Allan Kaprow and others, and he finds source material in the everyday. Ruppersberg s vast collection of early to mid-twentieth-century cultural ephemera-which includes calendars, snapshots, magazines, comic books, newspaper clippings, postcards, posters, and instructional films-form the basis of much of his recent work.nAs a teacher and artist, Ruppersberg has also influenced several Los Angeles artists of the generation following his, including, most notably, Jim Shaw and Mike Kelley, whose works also deal with the American vernacular. East Coast artist Rachel Harrison, who incorporates a deluge of cultural debris in her sculptures-celebrity magazines, costume jewelry, canned goods, and wigs-has acknowledged Ruppersberg s importance in the development of her own work. Ruppersberg has always had a strong, independent vision shaped first by growing up in America s heartland and also by spending months and years living and working in New York and Europe, where his work has been shown in an array of major museums.nTwo new large-scale installations in this exhibition continue to expand Ruppersberg s use of imagery culled from his vast archive of twentieth-century ephemera.鑱絋he Never Ending Book Part 2/Art and Therefore Ourselves�?2009), is a selection of more than 15,000 pages of Xeroxed images from the artist s book collection, installed in a stage-like environment made of theatrical props and early twentieth-century mural-sized vintage posters. The pages are stacked in approximately fifty small cardboard boxes designed by the artist. These duplicated pages are free for the taking. In this way, Ruppersberg makes his library available to each audience member who can subsequently create his or her own unique  book  to take home. As part of this project, Ruppersberg has created a 33 RPM vinyl LP record, which functions as an oral analog to the books on view. The record includes old songs and hymns, spoken word recordings, recipes read by poet Bill Berkson, and people singing around the piano, all dating from the early to mid-20th century.nFor the second installation,鑱絋he Sound and the Story/The Hugo Ball Award for 20th Century Graphics�?2009), photocopied and laminated items of everyday ephemera from Ruppersberg s extensive collection are suspended from a wall of pegboards. Viewers are invited to rearrange the materials on the pegboard to create their own narrative. During the run of the exhibition, Ruppersberg will periodically respond to these arrangements by reorganizing the items himself, thus creating a visual conversation with his audience  co-producers. nThe exhibition also includes a selection of earlier collages and drawings-two-dimensional works from important series鑱絋he Gift and the Inheritance�?1989), and鑱紺over Art�?1985); both of which provide an historical backdrop to the new installations.nRuppersberg s work is held in major collections including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.鑱紿e was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and lives and works in Los Angeles and New York.nAllen Ruppersberg: You and Me or The Art of Give and Take鑱絠s organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Guest curator of the exhibition is Constance Lewallen, Adjunct Curator at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.nThe publication that accompanies the exhibition was conceived by Ruppersberg as an artwork in itself, and is a cross between a traditional catalog and an artist s book. Based on a 1956 edition of travel guideThe Guest Informant,鑱絠t is spiral-bound and cardboard-covered. The publication contains essays by renowned author and cultural critic, Greil Marcus, and guest curator Constance Lewallen, along with an interview with and commentary on the artist, random ephemera, and exhibition information. It is co-published by JRP|Ringier, Switzerland. The new vinyl LP record will also be available in a limited edition of 200.nMajor support for the exhibition and publication is provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional funding is provided by LLWW Foundation, the Frederick R. Weisman Philanthropic Foundation, the Pasadena Art Alliance, and Margo Leavin Gallery. Related programming is made possible in part by a grant from the City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Arts Commission, Emily Fisher Landau, Lenore and Bernard Greenberg, and Judy and Stuart Spence.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

During the run of the exhibition, Ruppersberg will periodically respond to these arrangements by reorganizing the items himself, thus creating a visual conversation with his audience  co-producers. nThe exhibition also includes a selection of earlier collages and drawings-two-dimensional works from important series鑱絋he Gift and the Inheritance�?1989), and鑱紺over Art�?1985); both of which provide an historical backdrop to the new installations.nRuppersberg s work is held in major collections including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.鑱紿e was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and lives and works in Los Angeles and New York.nAllen Ruppersberg: You and Me or The Art of Give and Take鑱絠s organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art. Guest curator of the exhibition is Constance Lewallen, Adjunct Curator at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.nThe publication that accompanies the exhibition was conceived by Ruppersberg as an artwork in itself, and is a cross between a traditional catalog and an artist s book. Based on a 1956 edition of travel guideThe Guest Informant,鑱絠t is spiral-bound and cardboard-covered. The publication contains essays by renowned author and cultural critic, Greil Marcus, and guest curator Constance Lewallen, along with an interview with and commentary on the artist, random ephemera, and exhibition information. It is co-published by JRP|Ringier, Switzerland. The new vinyl LP record will also be available in a limited edition of 200.nMajor support for the exhibition and publication is provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional funding is provided by LLWW Foundation, the Frederick R. Weisman Philanthropic Foundation, the Pasadena Art Alliance, and Margo Leavin Gallery. Related programming is made possible in part by a grant from the City of Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Arts Commission, Emily Fisher Landau, Lenore and Bernard Greenberg, and Judy and Stuart Spence.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

With a fresh and vivid palette, a reductive, cartoon-like figurative style with a metallic-like patina reminiscent of video game robots and characters, Kelly creates scenes that on closer inspection reveal a mixture of personal archetypes and classic racial stereotypes.nThe artist s aesthetic includes references to the figurative work of Jacob Lawrence and to the controversial stop motion animations of George Pal, especially鑱絁ohn Henry and the Inky-Poo鑱絘nd the鑱絁asperseries from the 1940s. Like Pal, Kelly utilizes the perception of race as a narrative device, something to work with and work against in the children s formation of identity through play.nKelly was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1980 and grew up in Arlington, Texas. He received his B.F.A. in Painting from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and his M.F.A. from Yale University. The artist lives and works in New Haven, Connecticut, and also works in New York.n nSupport for the exhibition is provided by the Peter Norton Family Foundation on behalf of Eileen Harris Norton.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

With a fresh and vivid palette, a reductive, cartoon-like figurative style with a metallic-like patina reminiscent of video game robots and characters, Kelly creates scenes that on closer inspection reveal a mixture of personal archetypes and classic racial stereotypes.nThe artist s aesthetic includes references to the figurative work of Jacob Lawrence and to the controversial stop motion animations of George Pal, especially鑱絁ohn Henry and the Inky-Poo鑱絘nd the鑱絁asperseries from the 1940s. Like Pal, Kelly utilizes the perception of race as a narrative device, something to work with and work against in the children s formation of identity through play.nKelly was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1980 and grew up in Arlington, Texas. He received his B.F.A. in Painting from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and his M.F.A. from Yale University. The artist lives and works in New Haven, Connecticut, and also works in New York.n nSupport for the exhibition is provided by the Peter Norton Family Foundation on behalf of Eileen Harris Norton.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

The exhibition, co-curated by Meskerem Assegued, a revered Ethiopian curator and anthropologist, and visionary theater, opera, and multi-disciplinary arts impresario, Peter Sellars, is comprised of more than 100 works in a variety of mediums, scale, and forms. A highlight of the exhibition is a series of striking thrones made of leather, wood, mud and straw, which will be integrated into conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen s final Los Angeles Philharmonic concerts staged by Sellars in mid-April.nElias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart鑱絯ill be accompanied by a film by award-winning filmmakers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) that will uniquely document the exhibition.nUsing yarn, plastics, tattered fabric, buttons, used plastic, and bottle tops, each of the collages and stitched canvases Sime creates for鑱紼lias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart鑱絩epresent a complete essay about the current state of his surroundings. Sime s three-dimensional sculptures are made with traditional organic Ethiopian building materials such as mud and straw, as well as wood, metal, and other found objects, gathered in part by neighborhood children.nIt was Sellars  passion for Sime s work that initially inspired SMMoA s executive director Elsa Longhauser to consider the idea of an exhibition of Sime s work. During their conversations, Sellars explained that Sime s thrones, designed to elevate and celebrate Ethiopia s street culture, so moved him that he was determined to feature the thrones in his production of Stravinsky s鑱絆edipus Rex鑱絘nd鑱絊ymphony of Psalms, Salonen s final concerts on April 16, 17, 18 and 19. Sime originally designed the thrones for Sellars  2006 New Crowned Hope Festival, a celebration of Mozart s 250th anniversary in Vienna, Austria.nIn鑱紼lias Sime: Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart, the thrones make up part of the installation piece鑱組in Neber, a new iteration of a series of works in which Sime addresses the dignity, wisdom and depth of the ancient indigenous cultures that are rapidly disappearing from Ethiopia. Also, displayed in a semicircle around a small ceremonial table, the installation will include five wall sculptures, made from wood, cans, leather, and stitches, as well as a short, silent video installation documenting indigenous religious practices of small villages in Ethiopia. In鑱組ud and Straw, small mud and straw creatures take over the gallery space. A video installation documents Sime s construction of a Gota, the traditional grain storage container found in northern Ethiopia.nBIOGRAPHIES:nAs a child, Elias Sime taught himself to sew, embroider, and repair furniture. He collected cast-off objects and materials, such as flattened tin cans, and fashioned them into his own creations. Today Sime still collects energetically plastic shopping bags in different colors, plastic shoes, horns from slaughtered cattle and buys some of the raw material for his work, such as buttons, at the Mercato, Addis Abeba s sprawling central market. Just as he gathers materials for making art from the markets and streets, Sim�?finds the themes for his works in the streets of Addis. He documents the lives and portraits of Ethiopians living in the Cherkos Gebeya, Legaehar and Chide Terra areas surrounding Addis Abeba, where he finds most of his working materials. Sime has deep connections with the communities he documents, in particular with the neighborhood children who bring him objects they collect from the street.nBorn in Cherkos, outside of Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, Sime graduated from Addis Abeba University s School of Fine Art and Design with a degree in graphic design. His practice focuses mainly on collages, stitches, and three-dimensional sculpture. Sime has had numerous solo shows, and has participated in many group exhibitions including the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Peter Sellars  New Crowned Hope in Vienna, Austria; the Dak Art Biennale 2004, in Dakar, Senegal; and the Zoma Contemporary Art Center and the National Museum in Addis Ababa. Sim�?lives and works in Addis Ababa.nPeter Sellars, a director of opera, theatre and film, is renowned worldwide for his innovative treatments of classical material from western and non-western traditions, and for exploring the role of the performing arts in contemporary society and his commitment to spreading artistic vision to enact change. He has served as artistic director of the Los Angeles Festival, the American National Theatre at the Kennedy Center, the Boston Shakespeare Company and the Elitch Theatre for Children in Denver. Sellars is a professor in the department of World Arts and Cultures at UCLA, where he teaches Art as Social Action and Art as Moral Action. His past teaching positions include a visiting professorship at the Center for Theatre Arts at UC Berkeley. He resides in Los Angeles.nTrained as an anthropologist, Meskerem Assegued is the curator and founder of Addis Abeba s Zoma Contemporary Art Center. In 2006, she curated Green Flame in Vienna, Austria, part of the New Crowned Hope Festival, in which Sime participated.

Spanning the years from 1994 to 2007, the exhibition includes thirty-three multimedia artworks ranging from small sculptures, to large-scale photographs, to monumental installations. Kersels has long been esteemed in Southern California artistic and academic circles, and his work is in many collections worldwide. The advent of鑱紿eavyweight Champion鑱絤arks a timely opportunity for this 2008 Guggenheim Foundation Fellow to enjoy the broader recognition and respect his work and creative achievements so well deserve.nKersels is a long-time aficionado of Buster Keaton, and on first encounter, his artwork seems to exude a similar deadpan slapstick style, balancing the humorous with the wistfully awkward. On further study, this initial impression gives way to darker layers; the performances and works reveal what Kersels refers to as  wink-wink humor mixed with a tragic element.  Early pieces, including the large-scale photographic series of Kersels falling, tripping, tossing people, and being smacked with assorted objects, find the artist experimenting with the creative possibilities of his 6-foot, 7-inch, 350 lb. frame. But the trajectory of Kersels  career as illuminated in鑱紿eavyweight Champion鑱絚learly indicates that he is not a single-issue artist; he is not, in the words of Ian Berry  the body-issue guy.

While Condon s previous work was characterized by the subversive tactics of hacking and the intervention into commercial computer games,鑱絁udgment Modification鑱絩evealed his shift to composing projected moving-image installations that function as animated paintings. These noninteractive  self-playing  games run continuously, like games waiting for the viewer to pick up the controller.nCondon s creative process is informed by the software hacking logic he learned directly from online and offline fan subcultures. In his work he often reinterprets historical events and existing artworks. Examples of this include a two-hour  Deathmatch  battle between medieval reenactors (Untitled War,�?004) at Machine Project; and a computer simulation of the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, featuring an AK47-wielding David Koresh (Waco Resurrection,�?003, a C-level collaboration). Trained as a sculptor, Condon uses technology as the raw material for his art, creating works that are both profound and playful.nCondon lived for a number of years in the Netherlands, where he had easy access to 15th-century European religious paintings.

While Condon s previous work was characterized by the subversive tactics of hacking and the intervention into commercial computer games,鑱絁udgment Modification鑱絩evealed his shift to composing projected moving-image installations that function as animated paintings. These noninteractive  self-playing  games run continuously, like games waiting for the viewer to pick up the controller.nCondon s creative process is informed by the software hacking logic he learned directly from online and offline fan subcultures. In his work he often reinterprets historical events and existing artworks. Examples of this include a two-hour  Deathmatch  battle between medieval reenactors (Untitled War,�?004) at Machine Project; and a computer simulation of the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, featuring an AK47-wielding David Koresh (Waco Resurrection,�?003, a C-level collaboration). Trained as a sculptor, Condon uses technology as the raw material for his art, creating works that are both profound and playful.nCondon lived for a number of years in the Netherlands, where he had easy access to 15th-century European religious paintings. He believes that these works influence the visual style of games and fantasy art. He also believes that the catastrophic thinking these works reflect has greatly influenced the current political discourse.  The references to monsters and wars, the emergence of readings of the Bible, the distrust of science, the faith in religious structures to solve our problems, this type of pre-modern thinking is rooted in the late-Medieval period in northern Europe,  notes Condon.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

Hendricks  groundbreaking body of work has both influenced and paved the way for many of today s generation of artists.nHendricks calls his camera his  mechanical sketchbook,  as many of his paintings are realized from photographs of people he encountered in daily life.nBirth of the Cool鑱絠s organized by Trevor Schoonmaker, Curator of Contemporary Art at the鑱絟ttp://www.nasher.duke.edu/exhibitions_hendricks.php Nasher Museum of Art鑱絠n Durham, North Carolina.nThe exhibition catalog includes essays by Schoonmaker; Thelma Golden, Director and Chief Curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem; and Franklin Sirmans, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Menil Collection.nFollowing its presentation at SMMoA, the exhibition will travel to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston.

The exhibition included more than 100 photographs, videos, sculpture, and ephemera.nIn San Francisco in 1974, Lynn Hershman donned a wig and adopted a particular set of gestures to create an alter ego named Roberta Breitmore, a fictional character who grew so real over the years that she acquired her own driver s license, apartment, and romantic encounters. She also went to Weight Watchers, EST seminars, and psychotherapy. Hershman alternately describes Roberta as the  underbelly  of her own personality and a  mirror held up to her culture. nIn Southern California starting in 1972, Eleanor Antin gave birth to three  selves : a king, a ballerina, and a nurse, which she compared to Jungian archetypes. First, she painstakingly applied a beard and took to the streets of Solana Beach as a king attending his peoples. She next became her  idealized female self  a classical ballerina, practicing her technique every day so she could quasi-legitimately play the role in staged and taped performance. Later, in photographs and videos, she brought to life two different kinds of nurses: a flirtatious nurse worthy of any soap opera and a historical figure inspired by Florence Nightingale.nMeanwhile, in Montreal, Detroit-born artist Suzy Lake investigated the cultural construction of character by trying on various roles for size. She posed as a glamorous fashion model for one series, which took the form of a slideshow (1972-75). She borrowed the facial features of her friends for another, which consists of large-scale pre-Photoshop manipulated photographs called鑱絋ransformations�?1974). She also applied cosmetics directly to the surface of photographic prints, recognizing makeup as the oil paint of the day, and her face as the canvas.nTogether, Antin, Hershman, and Lake were pioneers of what art critic Kim Levin once called the  high-risk  art of self-transformation. Their work challenged fixed notions of identity and femininity, raising questions of who we are and whom we can pass as. They combined acting skills with more traditional artmaking techniques to document their double lives in detail. They relied above all on the medium of photography, paving the way for conceptual artists to come, from Cindy Sherman to Nikki S. Lee.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .

He also set up a studio inside the Museum to let people view the performance of his painting. Keene chose images of works from catalogs of Los Angeles art collections and then duplicated them simultaneously on thirty or forty plywood boards he had set up around the gallery. The paintings were hung throughout the museum salon-style, then sold for prices ranging from $3 to $25. Keene compares his paintings to souvenirs, trading cards, and music CDs:  It s art, it s cheap, and it changes your life, but the object has no status.  This was Keene s largest show to date and his first exhibition on the West Coast.n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" .
